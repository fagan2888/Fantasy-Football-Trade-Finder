the field, he's an exciting player to watch -- and a great option for your fantasy lineup. However, through two seasons it's clear that \"healthy and on the field\" might be more rare than we'd hope for the Florida State product. He's only played in 15 games over two seasons. He seems to be ready to go for Week 1, however, which means he'll get a shot as the team's primary back against an Atlanta defense which ranked among the top 10 most generous in terms of both yards and touchdowns allowed last season. Start him with confidence as an RB1.","2":"Cook looked strong in Week 1, leading the Vikings in both carries and yards while scoring a pair of touchdowns -- and catching a couple of passes, as well. He'll look to do more of the same against the Packers in Week 2, although that is a considerably worse matchup than the one against the Falcons to open the season. Green Bay looked solid on defense against the Bears in Week 1, so don't expect another huge game from Cook. Do lock him in as an RB2 regardless.","3":"Volume is king in fantasy football, and among running backs, Cook is the king of volume. No other back seems to be as integral to his team's offense, as the Vikings look to Cook in all situations. Only Marlon Mack has more carries, but Cook averages 1.5 more yards-per-attempt than the Colts running back. Cook even received 20 carries in a game that his team trailed 21-0 at one point, in Week 2 against the Packers. There's no reason to doubt the FSU product in Week 3, not even against a Raiders defense that has been surprisingly stingy against the run.","4":"No team favors the run over the pass quite like the Vikings, and that's been great news for Cook so far in 2019. His 57 attempts rank fourth in the NFL while his 375 yards are first overall. He's gone over 100 yards and scored a rushing touchdown in each of the first three games -- and he has also seen a few targets in the passing game. He's competing with Christian McCaffrey and Austin Ekeler for the top spot on the scoring charts -- and winning so far, according to ESPN-standard scoring. Week 4 will be a difficult one as the Vikings travel to Chicago to take on the Bears, but that's no reason to bench the Florida State product. Lower your expectationS slightly, but Cook remains an RB1."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":41.6764705882353,"averageDraftPosition":13.976079346557759,"percentChange":0.0491966678512199,"percentOwned":99.8415096596516,"percentStarted":98.31292515069399},"proTeamId":16,"rankings":{"0":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2}],"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":8.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":7.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":7.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":7.333333333333333,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":4.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":4.166666666666667,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":4.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankTy

two seasons into his NFL career, Cook has made it through only 13 games healthy. Though durability is obviously a concern, volume and efficiency are not. During those 13 weeks, Cook handled 61 percent of the team's designed runs (14.2 per game) and 14 percent of the targets (4.7 per game). He's averaging 4.7 YPC (2.1 YAC) on 207 career attempts. Cook has yet to emerge as a consistent fantasy threat, but did post the seventh-most fantasy points at the position after Week 12 last season, which aligned both with his return to full health and Minnesota's move to a run-first offense.

thrive as a receiving threat but, atop an otherwise thin depth chart, he could finally feast on all downs in what is an inviting enough matchup. The Titans, after all, were a bottom-half rush defense last season and yielded more than two yards after contact per rush to tailbacks.","2":"The Titans held Chubb in check for much of Week 1, but the workload—20 total touches—was inspired. The Jets rank 16th in defending running backs on the ground since the start of last season and have allowed the eighth-most yards after contact per rush, an area in which Chubb thrives. Few backs can be trusted to handle 20 touches each week for a capable offense the Browns'. Chubb is a strong RB1 option for Monday night.","3":"The Browns host the Rams on Sunday and, despite a strong defensive reputation, the Rams have allowed the eighth-most rushing yards to tailbacks since the start of last season—including a generous 4.9 per carry over that time. One of just six players averaging at least 20 touches this season, Chubb's uptick in receiving involvement since last season vaults him into the position's coveted bell-cow tier.","4":"The Georgia product netted the second-most carries of his career on his way to a season-high 96 rushing yards for the Browns. The Ravens have allowed the seventh-fewest fantasy points to enemy backfields this year, but LeSean McCoy's success in Week 3 against Baltimore is a good sign for Chubb's upside this week."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":29.309597523219814,"averageDraftPosition":27.442453537794815,"percentChange":-0.00967067802037036,"percentOwned":99.63808952851959,"percentStarted":95.54422207048674},"proTeamId":5,"rankings":{"0":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2}],"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":6.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":7.166666666666667,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":6.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":5.833333333333333,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":7.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":8.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR",

opened his NFL career buried behind both Carlos Hyde and Duke Johnson, but it didn't take long for the 2018 second-round pick to force his way into a massive role. Once he took over as the lead back in Week 7, Chubb handled 80 percent of the Browns' designed runs and 10 percent of the targets, and only seven backs scored more fantasy points. For the entire season, Chubb averaged 5.2 YPC (10th-highest at the position), including 2.41 after contact (seventh-best), and he averaged 0.53 fantasy points per snap, which was fourth-highest among backs. Chubb will open 2019 as Cleveland's clear feature back, though a limited role as a receiver and the return of Kareem Hunt around midseason limit his upside a bit. Chubb is best viewed as a strong RB2 in Cleveland's improved offense.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":3.3754965616875,"appliedStats":{"53":3.686961656,"72":-0.678531348,"24":29.70716389,"25":13.934085965999998,"26":0.11149425,"42":5.753429559000001,"43":1.458118002,"44":0.018188142,"63":0.01703487},"appliedTotal":54.007944987,"externalId":"2018","id":"102018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":69.29313075,"24":297.0716389,"25":2.322347661,"26":0.055747125,"27":59.0,"28":29.0,"29":14.0,"30":11.0,"31":5.0,"32":2.0,"33":13.0,"34":6.0,"35":0.132999187,"36":0.093099431,"37":0.276681388,"38":0.009442074,"39":4.287172995138483,"40":19.72259843,"41":7.373923312,"42":57.53429559,"43":0.243019667,"44":0.009094071,"45":0.044900303,"46":0.029342348,"47":11.0,"48":5.0,"49":2.0,"50":2.0,"51":1.0,"53":7.373923312,"54":1.0,"56":0.02804087,"57":8.67243E-4,"58":9.977536256,"60":7.802399503717541,"61":3.819704271,"62":0.064841196,"63":0.002839145,"66":0.652944834,"67":0.069484018,"68":0.722428852,"70":0.300354624,"71":0.03891105,"72":0.339265674,"73":0.339265674,"210":16.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":1.5,"24":16.5,"25":18.0,"42":1.8},"appliedTotal":37.8,"externalId":"401128018","id":"01401128018","proTeamId":5,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"210":1.0,"23":20.0,"24":165.0,"25":3.0,"27":33.0,"155":1.0,"28":16.0,"29":8.0,"158":18.0,"30":6.0,"31":3.0,"32":1.0,"33":4.0,"34":2.0,"35":1.0,"36":1.0,"37":1.0,"39":8.25,"40":165.0,"41":3.0,"42":18.0,"47":3.0,"48":1.0,"179":1.0,"180":1.0,"53":3.0,"58":4.0,"59":27.0,"60":6.0,"61":18.0}},{"appliedAverage":15.261606068400003,"appliedStats":{"53":17.87425728,"72":-1.30904148,"24":118.35479330000001,"25":52.554734766,"26":1.00196027,"42":28.98040363,"43":11.208109866,"44":0.226185466,"63":0.032687928},"appliedTotal":228.92409102600004,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":258.4816875,"24":1183.547933,"25":8.759122461,"26":0.500980135,"27":236.0,"28":118.0,"29":59.0,"30":47.0,"31":23.0,"33":51.0,"34":25.0,"35":0.546452525,"36":0.382516767,"37":3.914113446,"38":0.133573675,"39":4.578846356,"40":78.57579638,"42":289.8040363,"43":1.868018311,"44":0.113092733,"45":0.063571063,"46":0.04154369,"47":57.0,"48":28.0,"49":14.0,"50":11.0,"51":5.0,"53":35.74851456,"54":7.0,"55":3.0,"56":0.131227221,"57":0.004058574,"58":45.98750645,"60":8.10674345,"61":19.24010199,"62":0.614072868,"63":0.005447988,"66":1.217828381,"67":0.168428008,"68":1.386256389,"70":0.560201055,"71":0.094319684,"72":0.65452074,"73":0.65452074,"210":15.0625}},{"appliedStats":{"53":1.4725999525,"72":-0.09062828,"24":7.5883637230000005,"25":2.602374852,"26":0.056499174,"42":2.408627671,"43":0.605651124,"44":0.011994076,"63":0.0022500000000000003},"appliedTotal":14.6577322925,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":17.32288138,"24":75.88363723,"25":0.433729142,"26":0.028249587,"27":15.0,"28":7.0,"29":3.0,"30":3.0,"31":1.0,"33":3.0,"34":1.0,"35":0.036858543,"36":0.02580098,"37":0.252044248,"38":0.008601303,"39":4.380543604,"40":75.88363723,"42":24.08627671,"43":0.100941854,"44":0.005997038,"45":0.00362161,"46":0.002366722,"47":4.0,"48":2.0,"49":1.0,"53":2.945199905,"56":0.013777386,"57":4.26E-4,"58":3.895369193,"60":8.178146642,"61":24.08627671,"62":0.034246625,"63":3.75E-4,"66":0.081616213,"67":0.013876217,"68":0.095492431,"70":0.037543458,"71":0.007770682,"72":0.04531414,"73":0.04531414,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":1.5229175475,"72":-0.13206416,"24":8.106269246,"25":3.49223988,"26":0.064976496,"42":2.5144457110000005,"43":0.664395486,"44":0.013754112,"63":0.0032818739999999997},"appliedTotal":16.2502161925,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":18.0547282,"24":81.06269246,"25":0.58203998,"26":0.032488248,"27":16.0,"28":8.0,"29":4.0,"30":3.0,"31":1.0,"33":3.0,"34":1.0,"35":0.038639846,"36":0.027047892,"37":0.28766322,"38":0.00982,"39":4.489831779,"40":81.06269246,"42":25.14445711,"43":0.110732581,"44":0.006877056,"45":0.004023974,"46":0.002629667,"47":5.0,"48":2.0,"49":1.0,"50":1.0,"53":3.045835095,"56":0.015251305,"57":4.7169E-4,"58":3.966003542,"60":8.25535734,"61":25.14445711,"62":0.039365303,"63":5.46979E-4,"66":0.119090002,"67":0.020090499,"68":0.139180501,"70":0.054781401,"71":0.01125068,"72":0.06603208,"73":0.06603208,"210":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":12.879660616692309,"appliedStats":{"53":14.438600945,"72":-1.026752728,"24":90.46818016,"25":32.096399454,"26":0.665563214,"42":23.60236619,"43":7.026471156,"44":0.139140934,"63":0.025618692},"appliedTotal":167.43558801700001,"externalId":"2019","id":"122019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{"23":201.7215094,"24":904.6818016,"25":5.349399909,"26":0.332781607,"27":180.0,"28":90.0,"29":45.0,

top tight ends drafted in fantasy leagues, following a 2018 season with a (by far) career-high 1,163 yards and 116 receptions ,while tying his career-best with eight touchdowns. Though Washington held him to a 15-yard performance in Week 17 last year, he torched them for nine catches and 83 yards in Week 13. A near lock to approach double-digit targets most weeks, Ertz remains among the top fantasy options at his position for the 2019 opener.","2":"Ertz didn't find the end zone in Week 1 but still had a serviceable TE fantasy day, which is the minimum you'd want from such a high pick. The Falcons didn't give up a catch to any Vikings tight end in Week 1, but don't let that deter you from parking Ertz in fantasy TE1 territory.","3":"Ertz, who caught eight passes in Week 2, may be even busier than usual in Week 3 if at least one of Alshon Jeffery (calf), DeSean Jackson (groin) and Dallas Goedert (calf) is forced to be inactive. Regardless of how this injury picture shakes out, Ertz remains a top-flight fantasy TE1 against the Lions.","4":"Ertz had 64 yards in Week 3 (catching 4-of-7 targets) with Alshon Jeffery (calf) and DeSean Jackson (groin) out. The quick turnaround to Thursday's game at Green Bay probably will have Jackson out again, but Jeffery has a chance to suit up. That could take some defensive attention off Ertz, who remains a strong fantasy TE1 in Week 4, despite Green Bay's strong fantasy defense versus tight ends (5.7 points-per-game, the fourth-lowest mark)."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":22.159442724458206,"averageDraftPosition":33.58516048353481,"percentChange":-7.661635182643067E-4,"percentOwned":99.85410399273724,"percentStarted":95.63344429214803},"proTeamId":21,"rankings":{"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":2.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":3.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6}],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":3.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":3.1666666666666665,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":3.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":3.1666666666666665,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":37,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":37,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":37,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":59,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":37,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23}]},"seasonOutlook":"Ertz set the all-time tight end record with 116 receptions last season and was fantasy's No. 2 scorer at the position. Incredibly, Ertz has improved his fantasy point total each of his seasons in the NFL and has now posted four consecutive top-nine finishes. He paced all tight ends in snaps (949), routes (550) and targets (156), while ranking top-four in receiving yards (1,163), touchdowns (eight) and end-zone targets (nine) last season. After struggling in the area during his first four seasons, Ertz has scored exactly eight touchdowns in back-to-back seasons. The 28-year-old is an elite, high-floor fantasy option who could defer some targets to DeSean Jackson and Dallas Goedert and still post a top-three fantasy season.

almost surely coming for Williams after his 10-score performance last season. Countering this could be an uptick in overall usage and production. The Colts were stingy against wideouts last season, but a blend of red zone and big-play potential supports WR3 value for Williams.","2":"Williams wasn't very busy in Week 1 in seeing just four targets, but he was also a key focus of the Colts' defense. A stronger Week 2 showing could be in the books if the Lions use top corner Darius Slay to shadow Keenan Allen. Somewhat of a boom-or-bust player dependent on big plays around the red zone, Williams remains in the starting mix among receivers heading into Motown.","3":"Questionable with a knee injury heading in, Williams gamely handled 25 routes in Week 2 and delivered an impressive 83 yards in the loss to the Lions. The Texans don't pose a great threat to Williams' production potential given their struggles in coverage in the secondary, thus Williams is a worthy WR3 or flex option this week.","4":"Limited to just 15 targets on the season so far, Williams has yet to meet expectations in 2019. The good news is a matchup with Miami looms, setting up this big-play maven with a choice opportunity to deliver vertical plays against a Dolphins defense allowing 16.7 yards per reception to wideouts."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":7.656346749226006,"averageDraftPosition":85.89606601100184,"percentChange":-2.668228590406301,"percentOwned":86.96341568476956,"percentStarted":32.314139674434266},"proTeamId":24,"rankings":{"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":23,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":22,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":22,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":24,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":39,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":26,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":23,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":37,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":21.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":28.166666666666668,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":21,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":23,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":23,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":38,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":24,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":22,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":22,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":22.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":30.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":22,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":30,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":41,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":30,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":28,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":33,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":35,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":21,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":33,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":31,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":25.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":33.833333333333336,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":29,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":63,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":63,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":63,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":46,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":63,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":47.333333333333336,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}]},"seasonOutlook":"Williams managed a top 35 fantasy campaign last season despite handling more than six targets in only two games. Touchdowns were the difference-maker for the 2017 first-round pick, as he scored 10 times on 66 targets. That 15.2 percent hit rate was tops at the position and is far from sustainable. Williams racked up 12 end zone targets (13th most), but his 6.2 OTD suggests he was over his head. The good news is that Williams' efficiency was otherwise good. He caught 65 percent of his targets despite a 14.6 aDOT (10th highest) and ranked 11th in both YPR (15.4) and YPT (10.1). Williams caught a first down on a position-best 44 percent of his targets.

role against the Colts this week with Melvin Gordon still holding out for a new contract, Ekeler is likely to split rushing duties nearly evenly with Justin Jackson but most valuably should dominate passing work. A solid RB2 option with Gordon not playing, Ekeler is in a strong spot to return value against a Colts team that allowed the seventh-most receiving yards to backs last year.","2":"An awesome opener for Ekeler saw him become the first Chargers player with 150 yards from scrimmage and three touchdowns in a season opener. With receiving and red zone duties secured while Melvin Gordon holds out, Ekeler is in a strong spot to replicate the solid scrimmage showing David Johnson enjoyed against the Lions last week. Given his awesome receiving role, Ekeler is knocking on the RB1 door in PPR formats for Week 2.","3":"A costly fumble this past week hurt the Chargers' chances in Detroit, but overall Ekeler remains an awesome fantasy option and a plus playmaker for the Chargers. The Texans have struggled against gifted receiving backs since the start of last season, setting up Ekeler with another RB1 projection.","4":"The Dolphins have allowed a league-high 535 rushing yards to tailbacks on the season to go with four rushing scores. Ekeler is on pace for a historically great receiving campaign and has seemingly consolidated goal-line duties, as well. With a choice matchup in Miami, Ekeler is firmly in the must-start tier of tailbacks.

it has been in a situational role behind Melvin Gordon, but Ekeler has been one of the league's most efficient backs since he entered the league as an undrafted free agent in 2017. Ekeler is averaging 5.3 YPC (2.4 YAC) on 153 carries and 7.9 YPT on 86 targets in 30 career games. He ranked fourth in YAC last season and has finished top-six in YPR and YPT in both seasons. He has also ranked top-eight in fantasy points per snap both seasons. The 24-year-old will be on the early-season RB1 radar with Gordon continuing his lengthy holdout and could flirt with standalone value once Gordon does report. Ekeler is a good mid-round

until Week 10 of his rookie season, Jackson compiled an incredible 695 yards on the ground—the ninth-most by a quarterback in a season since 2001. His sophomore campaign begins against an exploitable Miami defense that allowed the seventh-most rushing yards per attempt and the eighth-most points per drive in 2018. Jackson can deliver QB1 numbers in the opener despite being drafted as a backup option in most leagues.","2":"Jackson's five-score opus saw him become the first player in Ravens history with a perfect passer rating in a game and the first with one in a season opener in NFL history. Jackson provided amazing statistical results with just six rushing yards against Miami in the opener, meaning his fantasy ceiling is somehow even higher once he lets loose on the ground. The visiting Cardinals posted the fourth-highest blitz rate in the league in Week 1, suggesting Jackson might have to evacuate the pocket a bit more in Week 2, adding to his already-intriguing fantasy potential. He's a breakout starting option.","3":"Jackson leads ESPN leagues in fantasy points through two games thanks to following up Week 1's five-score opus with just the second game in NFL history with at least 250 passing yards and 120 rushing yards. This unique dual-threat has rare upside for this meeting with a Chiefs team that has allowed the sixth-most points per drive to opponents since the start of last season.","4":"Jackson is now 8-2 in his career as a starter in the regular season, with both losses at the Chiefs by a combined eight points. Big-play production in the Ravens' passing game this season has complemented Jackson's already elite rushing ability. Jackson is second only to Matthew Stafford with 22 pass attempts at least 20 yards downfield.

took \"dual threat\" quarterback to a new level during his rookie season, setting an NFL single-season quarterback record with 147 carries despite starting only seven regular-season games. Jackson averaged a massive 17.0 carries per game and ranked seventh in the entire NFL with 556 rushing yards during his seven starts. Jackson did, however, struggle as a passer. He completed 58 percent of his passes (fourth worst) and was off target on 22 percent of his throws (second worst). The Baltimore offense averaged 1.9 touchdowns per game during Jackson's starts, which would have ranked seventh worst over the full season. Jackson's legs provide him with QB1 upside, but a lack of passing volume and efficiency, coupled with inherent durability concerns makes him more of a QB2 target.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":2.0796863292500003,"appliedStats":{"19":0.139443768,"4":5.786292528,"20":-1.902720658,"8":10.0,"72":-0.783804684,"24":14.226108600000002,"25":5.733908082,"26":0.056196032,"63":0.0195576},"appliedTotal":33.274981268000005,"externalId":"2018","id":"102018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":36.73539349,"1":21.96548887,"2":14.769904619999998,"3":252.0884674,"4":1.446573132,"5":50.0,"6":25.0,"7":12.0,"8":10.0,"9":5.0,"10":2.0,"11":4.0,"12":2.0,"13":2.0,"14":1.0,"15":0.227643886,"16":0.14876528,"17":0.19025106,"18":0.02569793,"19":0.069721884,"20":0.951360329,"21":0.597938032,"22":118.0742236,"23":23.75179583,"24":142.261086,"25":0.955651347,"26":0.028098016,"27":28.0,"28":14.0,"29":7.0,"30":5.0,"31":2.0,"32":1.0,"33":4.0,"34":2.0,"35":0.04473789,"36":0.031316523,"37":0.106385192,"38":0.003630518,"39":5.989487574674897,"40":66.63282716,"62":0.0978199,"63":0.0032596,"64":2.889784645,"65":0.518574968,"66":0.310839909,"68":0.829414876,"69":0.248915984,"70":0.142986358,"72":0.391902342,"73":1.343262671,"210":16.0}},{"appliedStats":{"4":12.0,"20":-4.0,"8":9.0,"24":6.6000000000000005},"appliedTotal":23.6,"externalId":"401128018","id":"01401128018","proTeamId":33,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"0":34.0,"64":4.0,"1":24.0,"2":10.0,"3":247.0,"68":1.0,"4":3.0,"5":49.0,"6":24.0,"7":12.0,"8":9.0,"9":4.0,"73":2.0,"10":2.0,"11":4.0,"12":2.0,"13":2.0,"14":1.0,"15":1.0,"16":1.0,"210":1.0,"20":2.0,"21":70.59,"22":247.0,"23":9.0,"24":66.0,"27":13.0,"28":6.0,"156":1.0,"29":3.0,"158":18.0,"30":2.0,"31":1.0,"33":1.0,"39":7.333,"40":66.0,"175":2.0}},{"appliedStats":{"8":10.0,"24":4.6000000000000005,"25":6.0},"appliedTotal":20.6,"externalId":"401127953","id":"01401127953","proTeamId":33,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"0":43.0,"1":22.0,"2":21.0,"3":267.0,"5":53.0,"6":26.0,"7":13.0,"8":10.0,"9":5.0,"10":2.0,"11":4.0,"12":2.0,"13":4.0,"14":2.0,"21":51.163,"22":267.0,"23":8.0,"24":46.0,"25":1.0,"27":9.0,"28":4.0,"29":2.0,"30":1.0,"33":1.0,"39":5.75,"40":46.0,"64":3.0,"156":1.0,"158":6.0,"179":1.0,"210":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":19.189970851857144,"appliedStats":{"19":2.186060792,"4":57.07880692,"20":-18.705582984,"8":123.0,"72":-11.852868008,"24":81.68511241,"25":34.65972936,"26":0.314028714,"63":0.294304722},"appliedTotal":268.659591926,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":424.9741259,"1":260.8609894,"2":164.1131364,"3":3098.758734,"4":14.26970173,"5":619.0,"6":309.0,"7":154.0,"8":123.0,"9":61.0,"10":30.0,"11":52.0,"12":26.0,"15":2.229455495,"16":1.456949166,"17":1.751265449,"18":0.236550044,"19":1.093030396,"20":9.352791492,"21":0.613827933,"22":210.2278652,"23":161.2546026,"24":816.8511241,"25":5.77662156,"26":0.157014357,"27":163.0,"28":81.0,"29":40.0,"30":32.0,"31":16.0,"33":32.0,"34":16.0,"35":0.323385953,"36":0.226370167,"37":1.831840465,"38":0.062513687,"39":5.065598816,"40":55.41730829,"62":1.250044753,"63":0.049050787,"64":37.82708873,"65":9.256024292,"66":3.225092052,"68":12.48111634,"69":4.44289166,"70":1.483542344,"72":5.926434004,"73":15.2792255,"210":14.74}},{"appliedStats":{"19":0.181719056,"4":5.426773624,"20":-1.465106512,"8":9.0,"72":-0.660137922,"24":5.173617415,"25":1.97154942,"26":0.01989711,"63":0.01638},"appliedTotal":19.664692191,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"0":31.90098879,"1":19.74185259,"2":12.1591362,"3":242.1715709,"4":1.356693406,"5":48.0,"6":24.0,"7":12.0,"8":9.0,"9":4.0,"10":2.0,"11":3.0,"12":1.0,"15":0.19842232,"16":0.129668986,"17":0.197838806,"18":0.026722835,"19":0.090859528,"20":0.732553256,"21":0.61884767,"22":242.1715709,"23":10.02388711,"24":51.73617415,"25":0.32859157,"26":0.009948555,"27":10.0,"28":5.0,"29":2.0,"30":2.0,"31":1.0,"33":2.0,"34":1.0,"35":0.020087181,"36":0.014061027,"37":0.117035485,"38":0.003993972,"39":5.161288588,"40":51.73617415,"62":0.100808084,"63":0.00273,"64":3.291103468,"65":0.540190365,"66":0.153864317,"68":0.694054681,"69":0.259291375,"70":0.070777586,"72":0.330068961,"73":1.062622217,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"19":0.181792566,"4":5.624920692,"20":-1.416551336,"8":10.0,"72":-0.718167306,"24":4.905901382,"25":2.4040214939999998,"26":0.025389908,"63":0.017797902},"appliedTotal":21.025105302000004,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"0":32.72598139,"1":20.66946624,"2":12.05651515,"3":250.9810439,"4":1.406230173,"5":50.0,"6":25.0,"7":12.0,"8":10.0,"9":5.0,"10":2.0,"11":4.0,"12":2.0,"15":0.211979433,"16":0.13852856,"17":0.226382907,"18":0.030578395,"19":0.090896283,"20":0.708275668,"21":0.631591945,"22":250.9810439,"23":9.806488277,"24":49.05901382,"25":0.400670249,"26":0.012694954,"27":

The veteran wideout has seen volume with every passer the Cardinals have put on the field throughout his career, so expect more of the same against Detroit. The Lions allowed the fifth-most yards-per-catch last season (7.9), so this is as good a matchup as any. ","2":"Who are you calling \"old?\" The 36-year-old Pitt product looked like the same player we've seen for years, hauling in 8-of-13 targets for 113 yards and a score to kick off his 16th season in the NFL. Kyler Murray is certainly comfortable throwing to the experienced receiver, and Fitzgerald is just as comfortable finding ways to get open for the rookie. He's facing a very tough Ravens defense that limited DeVante Parker of the Dolphins to only three catches for 75 yards in Week 1, so consider him more of a flex pick than a WR2, given the difficulty of the matchup.","3":"The veteran Fitzgerald was always going to be a go-to option in the passing game for a rookie quarterback, and that has indeed proven to be the case through two weeks. He has seen 24 targets, 13 of which he's caught for a total of 217 yards. He's among the league leaders in targets and figures to keep getting a healthy dose of looks in the passing game against the Panthers in Week 3. Carolina allowed a big game to Chris Godwin in Week 2,  but are otherwise a pretty solid pass defense. Consider Fitzgerald as a borderline WR2 who makes for a great flex if you have better options ahead of him.","4":"While the Chargers' Keenan Allen is on another planet and in first place in targets in the NFL, the veteran Fitzgerald is right in the mix at the top of the league in the opportunity metric of choice for receivers. He's turned those opportunities into fantasy points on a routine basis, scoring in double-digits every week and finding the end zone twice. This week, his Cardinals will face a Seattle defense which allowed John Ross to have a breakout game in Week 1, but has otherwise kept wide receivers quiet this season. That's no reason to downgrade Fitzgerald out of your lineup, however, as he's squarely in the WR2 discussion."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":2.0526315789473686,"averageDraftPosition":112.43645303775314,"percentChange":1.8942912201559494,"percentOwned":92.30120232305303,"percentStarted":58.594007537035495},"proTeamId":22,"rankings":{"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":41,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":37,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":37,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":36,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":43,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":35,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":39,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":40,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":41,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":30,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":40.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":36.333333333333336,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":33,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":27,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":27,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":27,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":41,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":26,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":38,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":36,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":32,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":27,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":36.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":30.666666666666668,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":20,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":28,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":29,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":21,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":24,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":29,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":24,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":22.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":24.166666666666668,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":17,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":34,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":20,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":34,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":34,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"ave

future Hall of Famer, Fitzgerald will return for his 16th NFL season. The 2004 first-round pick posted three-consecutive seasons with at least 107 receptions and 1,023 yards prior to regressing in 2018, when he posted a 69/734/6 line and finished 25th in fantasy points. In addition, he managed only two top-20 fantasy weeks. Quarterback play was an obvious issue, helping Fitzgerald to a 6.6 YPT, which was ninth-worst at the position and his worst mark in the category since 2012. It's possible Kliff Kingsbury's modern offense can help Fitzgerald to a rebound season, but it's hard to see a ton of upside for a 36-year-old receiver, especially after Arizona drafted three wide receivers. Fitzgerald is best-viewed as a flex

spot for McCoy, if not a troubling addition for fantasy investors in other parts of this backfield. McCoy isn't likely to consume a ton of touches right away for Andy Reid, especially against a solid front seven. \"Shady's\" season-long prospects appear brighter than this initial matchup indicates.","2":"McCoy was second worst among qualifying rushers last season with just 3.2 yards per carry, so netting 8.1 per attempt on 10 tries in Week 1 is a promising turn. This is still clearly a committee approach for Kansas City, but it's possible McCoy can ascend into a bigger role if he continues to prove efficient. For this meeting in Oakland, McCoy is a somewhat risky flex given it's mostly a gamble on a short touchdown.","3":"As the team's closing back this past week, McCoy led the team with 14 total touches but tallied just 23 scrimmage yards in the process. The usage is much more encouraging than the production for McCoy, but even a nice role on the Chiefs isn't enough to offset this difficult matchup with a Baltimore defense that has held opposing backs to just 28 rushing yards on 1.56 yards per attempt this season, the stingiest defensive rates in the NFL currently.","4":"Fresh from producing his first game since 2017 with a rushing and receiving score, McCoy could return to sharing meaningful touches with Damien Williams this week. The matchup is at least inviting, as the Lions have allowed the 10th-most rushing yards to tailbacks this season."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":1.4303405572755419,"averageDraftPosition":120.26076814129802,"percentChange":4.293518735926369,"percentOwned":86.96372832699187,"percentStarted":33.361694310906564},"proTeamId":12,"rankings":{"0":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":47,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":44,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":46,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":39,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":48,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":47,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":38,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":34,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":44.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":42.333333333333336,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":38,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":28,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":31,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":28,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":33,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":29,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":35,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":27,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":31,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":27,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":29.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":30.166666666666668,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":30,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":24,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":24,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":17,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":23,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":20,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":24,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":22,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":22,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":22.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":21.666666666666668,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":23,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":22,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":29,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":22,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":22,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":27,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":28,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":21,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":24,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":22.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":24.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":64,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":21,"rankSourceId":9,"rankTyp

appeared in 14 games in 2018, but it still felt like a lost season for the veteran back. McCoy carried the ball 161 times (his lowest total since 2009) and was targeted on 43 occasions (his lowest since 2014). McCoy struggled to a career-low 3.19 YPC (third-worst at the position) and finished dead last in YAC (0.96) for the second consecutive season. McCoy's best weekly finish was 13th, and he failed to finish as a top-20 fantasy back for the first time since 2009. McCoy has rushed for six or fewer touchdowns four of the past five seasons. He's entering his age-31 season in a much better offense, as he'll compete with Damien Williams and Darwin Thompson for lead back roles in Kansas City.

ninth-most touchdowns and third-most yards per catch to receivers last season, yet it’s unclear if Brown is ready for top billing in the Baltimore passing game given the rookie played sparingly in the preseason. It's best to see how this passing offense performs in Miami before starting Brown.","2":"All Brown did for the Ravens in Week 1 was become the first player in NFL history with multiple 40-yard receiving scores in his first game. The Cardinals are missing their top cover corner to suspension and saw an offseason shuffle at safety, so this matchup is an inviting spot for \"Hollywood\" to follow up on his historic debut. ","3":"Brown's brilliant start to his career continued in Week 2, when he led the Ravens with 13 targets and a healthy 11.0 air yards per target in the process. Brown is emerging as a trusted fantasy play; he's the main target for Lamar Jackson heading into a game that has the highest point total on the Week 3 slate.","4":"Brown led the Ravens in targets at Arrowhead in Week 3 and leads the team for the season with a robust target-per-route rate of 34%. He's the clear top option in an emergent passing attack, and Cleveland has been middle-of-the-pack defending wide outs this season. The attention Brown gets from Lamar Jackson plus his unique vertical skill set make for another solid week as a flex option."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":2.153250773993808,"averageDraftPosition":127.74687447907985,"percentChange":2.6117059621569325,"percentOwned":89.51970723927778,"percentStarted":49.42793472688956},"proTeamId":33,"rankings":{"1":[],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":41,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":45,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":36,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":43,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":44,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":47,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":28,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":32,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":45.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":42.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":27,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":20,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":23,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":21,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":23,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":30,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":20,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":24.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":23.666666666666668,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":24,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":52,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":24,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":23,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":26,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":52,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":52,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":24,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":23.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":24.666666666666668,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":50,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":52,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23}]},"seasonOutlook":"The Ravens selected Brown with the No. 25 pick in April's draft. The former Oklahoma Sooner is extremely small (5-foot-9, 166 pounds), but he is superfast with the ability to get behind the defense and make plays with the ball in his hands. Drops (eight last season) and durability (he suffered a Lisfranc injury prior to the draft) are red flags, but Brown has the skill set of DeSean Jackson and John Brown, which allows him plenty of upside. The biggest concern here is that Brown's short-term fantasy value will be hindered by Baltimore's extremely run-heavy offense and Lamar Jackson's shaky accuracy. Brown is only worth a late flier in 2019 fantasy drafts because he has a good chance to lead the team in targets as a rookie.","stats":[{"appliedStats":{"53":2.0,"42":2.2},"appliedTotal":4.2,"externalId":"401128018","id":"01401128018","proTeamId":33,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"48":2.0,"49":1.0,"210":1.0,"53":4.0,"41":4.0,"58":7.0,"42":22.0,"59":8.0,"60":5.5,"156":1.0,"61":22.0,"47":4.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":1.0,"42":4.9},"appliedTotal":5.9,"externalId":"401127953","id":"01401127953","proTeamId":33,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"41":2.0,"42":49.0,"47":9.0,"48":4.0,"49":2.0,"50":1.0,"53":2.0,"58":9.0,"59":7.0,"60":24.5,"61":49.0,"156":1.0,"210":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":6.907989705466667,"appliedStats":{"53":20.640228285,"72":-0.53575833,"24":3.2557738790000004,"25":0.9302111820000001,"26":0.008421584,"42":61.67333817,"43":17.197277112,"44":0.438837492,"63":0.011516208},"appliedTotal":103.61984558200001,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":5.366369489,"24":32.55773879,"25":0.155035197,"26":0.004210792,"27":6.0,"28":3.0,"29":1.0,"30":1.0,"33":1.0,"35":0.009872072,"36":0.00691045,"37":0.002679192,"38":9.14306E-5,"39":6.066995361,"40":2.16150963,"42":616.7333817,"43":2.866212852,"44":0.219418746,"45":0.195518761,"46":0.127771511,"47":123.0,"48":61.0,"49":30.0,"50":24.0,"51":12.0,"53":41.28045657,"54":8.0,"55":4.0,"56":0.759584961,"57":0.023492318,"58":75.07124443,"60":14.94008141,"61":40.9449548,"62":0.223629538,"63":0.001919368,"66":0.056185487,"67":0.432203288,"68":0.488388775,"70":0.025845324,"71":0.242033841,"72":0.267879165,"73":0.267879165,"210":15.0625}},{"appliedStats":{"53":2.0288801925,"72":-0.05061944,"24":0.18933826890000002,"25":0.05135885999999999,"26":5.1832E-4,"42":6.476199935,"43":2.0360450279999998,"44":0.04544271,"63":0.00108},"appliedTotal":10.778243874400001,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":0.315277686,"24":1.893382689,"25":0.00855981,"26":2.5916E-4,"35":5.79875E-4,"36":4.05913E-4,"37":1.43259E-4,"38":4.89E-6,"39":6.005444646,"40":1.893382689,"42":64.76199935,"43":0.339340838,"44":0.022721355,"45":0.015790106,"46":0.010318834,"47":12.0,"48":6.0,"49":3.0,"50":2.0,"51":1.0,"53":4.057760385,"56":0.187677721,"57":0.005804466,"58":7.38241193,"60":15.96003539,"61":64.76199935,"62":0.022980515,"63":1.8E-4,"66":0.003300934,"67":0.042484447,"68":0.045785381,"70":0.00151843,"71":0.02379129,"72":0.02530972,"73":0.02530972,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":2.185591427,"72":-0.05388784,"24":0.16396998740000002,"25":0.05390313000000001,"26":5.69294E-4,"42":6.344126411,"43":2.025110478,"44":0.043628128,"63":0.00114657},"appliedTotal":10.764157585400001,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":0.273035549,"24":1.639699874,"25":0.008983855,"26":2.84647E-4,"35":5.01986E-4,"36":3.5139E-4,"37":1.05817E-4,"38":3.61E-6,"39":6.005444646,"40":1.639699874,"42":63.44126411,"43":0.337518413,"44":0.021814064,"45":0.01590806,"46":0.010395917,"47":12.0,"48":6.0,"49":3.0,"50":2.0,"51":1.0,"53":4.371182854,"56":0.178477325,"57":0.005519917,"58":7.217960612,"60":14.51352328,"61":63.44126411,"62":0.022098711,"63":1.91095E-4,"66":0.002858662,"67":0.045765957,"68":0.048624619,"70":0.001314984,"71":0.025628936,"72":0.02694392,"73":0.02694392,"210":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":11.076083823923076,"appliedStats":{"53":27.227927185,"72":-0.677124892,"24":2.411351904,"25":0.654799806,"26":0.006733362,"42":86.77834959,"43":26.980175232,"44":0.592445148,"63":0.014432376},"appliedTotal":143.989089711,"externalId":"2019","id":"122019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{"23":4.003011199,"24":24.11351904,"25":0.109133301,"26":0.003366681,"27":4.0,"28":2.0,"29":1.0,"35":0.007362186,"36":0.00515353,"37":0.001798925,"38":6.13904E-5,"39":6.02384501,"40":1.85488608,"42":867.7834959,"43":4.496695872,"44":0.296222574,"45":0.204843039,"46":0.133864926,"47":173.0,"48":86.0,"49":43.0,"50":34.0,"51":17.0,"53":54.45585437,"54":10.0,"55":5.0,"56":2.628610041,"57":0.081297218,"58":99.07325006,"60":15.93554092,"61":66.75257661,"62":0.299589254,"63":0.002405396,"66":0.041911227,"67":0.570148716,"68":0.612059944,"70":0.019279165,"71":0.319283281,"72":0.338562446,"73":0.338562446,"210":13.0}},{"appliedAverage":15.733333333333334,"appliedStats":{"53":7.0,"42":28.200000000000003,"43":12.0},"appliedTotal":47.2,"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"41":14.0,"42":282.0,"43":2.0,"45":2.0,"46":1.0,"47":55.0,"48":26.0,"49":13.0,"210":3.0,"50":9.0,"51":3.0,"52":1.0,"53":14.0,"54":1.0,"56":1.0,"58":27.0,"59":127.0,"155":2.0,"60":20.14285714,"156":1.0,"61":94.0,"158":12.0}}],"universeId":1},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":13,"totalRank

receiver drafted to pair with Pat Mahomes' strong arm, it will likely take months, if not longer, for Hardman to develop into a weekly fantasy threat. The Jaguars, meanwhile, surrendered just the fourth-fewest yards to receivers last season.","2":"Rare 4.33 speed and what should be a sizable uptick in attention means Hardman is suddenly on the radar as a streaming option. Tyreek Hill's injury vaults Hardman into a starting outside role. We didn't see the rookie earn a target last week, but a soft defensive opponent and an expected uptick in work results in Hardman as a fun flier to consider.","3":"It was Demarcus Robinson who enjoyed gobs of air yardage and success with Pat Mahomes in Week 2 with Tyreek Hill absent, but in this somewhat equal-opportunity big-play offense, there's always room for Hardman to deliver flex-worthy results in a single play. The Ravens' back seven is uniquely equipped to handle Hardman's speed, so the floor is decidedly low for the rookie.","4":"With 14.4 air yards per target the past two weeks, Hardman's awesome per-catch rate of 26.3 yards appears somewhat sustainable. Afforded just a handful of targets each week, Hardman's prospects this week are somewhat boom-or-bust against Detroit's exploitable secondary."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":0.33436532507739936,"averageDraftPosition":159.2999583506872,"percentChange":14.750534918482828,"percentOwned":58.66068599704526,"percentStarted":25.563873907548814},"proTeamId":12,"rankings":{"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":37,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":50,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":37,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":50,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":42,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":42,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":50,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":31,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":38,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":37,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":41.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":43.833333333333336,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":43,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":45,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":44,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":45,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":46,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":48,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":46,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":42,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":42,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":43,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":44.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":44.666666666666664,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":33,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":35,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":36,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":35,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":72,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":35,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":36,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":37,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":31,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":72,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":37,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":72,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":32,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":33.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":35.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":70,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":72,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23}]},"seasonOutlook":"The Chiefs selected Hardman in the second round of April's draft to complement Tyreek Hill, who has a similar skill set. Hardman is undersized at 5-foot-10, 187 pounds, but the Georgia product is extremely explosive and versatile. Hardman has terrific speed (4.33 40-yard dash) and toughness (17 bench reps) and dominates with the ball in his hands (8.7 RAC in 2018). He has struggled with drops (eight on 91 career targets) and fumbles (eight on 39 touches last season). Hardman figures to be utilized as a short-area RAC target, lid lifter and a returner. He's positioned for situational rookie season role in a high-scoring, Patrick Mahomes-led offense, which makes him a fine bench stash in deeper

Dorsett was a full-time player during Julian Edelman's four-game suspension last season, but was limited to a 16/165/2 line and the 45th-most fantasy points among wideouts during the span. He was a non-factor for a majority of the rest of the season and failed to finish as a Top 75 fantasy receiver for the fourth time in four NFL seasons. The 2015 first-round pick spent his early career as a downfield target, but was used more in the short area in 2018 (10.3 aDOT). He's undersized at 5-foot-10, 185 pounds and offers little near the goal line (six career touchdowns). Dorsett has little value behind Julian Edelman, Josh Gordon and likely Demaryius

ball-hawks. The unit is in a choice spot against Ryan Fitzpatrick, who had the highest interception rate in the NFL last season (4.9). It should have fantasy managers salivating.","2":"Another choice matchup awaits the Ravens' aggressive, ball-hawking defense. The Cardinals found their offensive groove late against the Lions in Week 1, but Kyler Murray struggled early and often as a passer, which helps support a strong projection for this D/ST in Week 2.","3":"As productive as Baltimore's D/ST has been, a matchup with the Chiefs' video game offense at Arrowhead isn't an inviting one for fantasy managers. This game's point total already has risen to 55 at some books, which means this is expected to be a high-scoring matchup without strong defensive performances.","4":"The upside sell for this group begins with Baltimore's strong pass rush; the Ravens have pressured passers on 35.6% of dropbacks, the fourth-highest clip this season. The Browns, meanwhile, have allowed pressure on 35.3% of Baker Mayfield's dropbacks this year. Cleveland's offense is talented at the skill positions, but a porous offensive line could help this D/ST produce a solid showing."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":0.17262830482115085,"averageDraftPosition":158.28501043841337,"percentChange":2.563524626340154,"percentOwned":60.966158987804604,"percentStarted":42.29769680996393},"proTeamId":33,"rankings":{"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":4.166666666666667,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":6.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16}],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":2.1666666666666665,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":2.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":23,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":23,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":25.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":25.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":8.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":8.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16}]},"seasonOutlook":"Baltimore's D/ST has been a fantasy powerhouse for a long time, posting four top-seven campaigns the past five seasons and seven in the past 11 seasons.

On the other hand, the unit ranked 22nd in forced turnovers and was outside the top 10 in sacks for the fourth consecutive season. The worst news is that Baltimore lost its Nos. 1, 2, 5 and 7 snap-getters from 2018 (Eric Weddle, C.J. Mosley, Terrell Suggs, Za'Darius Smith).

overall pick in 2019 drafts, Barkley will remain a fantasy lineup fixture regardless of the matchup. The Cowboys were one of few defenses to at least contain him in 2018, though he still topped 100 scrimmage yards in both of those matchups. With his excellent work in the receiving game, Barkley will all but guarantee 20-plus touches each week. We have him ranked near the top of his position for Week 1.","2":"Barkley rattled off 139 scrimmage yards but only touched the ball 15 times in a failed Week 1 comeback attempt. He'll next face the Bills, who held Jets running backs in check in Week 1, though Le'Veon Bell did manage to find the end zone. Matchups rarely matter for Barkley, who again should be considered a surefire fantasy RB1 in Week 2.","3":"Barkley saw more work in Week 2 after his surprisingly low touch count in Week 1. Despite questions surrounding New York's offense, the star running back remains a constant. Daniel Jones takes over at quarterback, which could open things up for Barkley to see slightly less defensive attention. Then again, stacked boxes have not stopped him often to begin with. Fire him into fantasy lineups as a high-end RB1 against the Buccaneers in Week 3.","4":"Barkley suffered a high-ankle sprain in Week 3 and is expected to miss at least one month. Pick up Wayne Gallman, who's expected to be his top replacement during his absence. Stash Barkley in all leagues as he'll return to being an elite play almost immediately upon activation -- though that may not happen until after the Giants' Week 11 bye."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":53.845201238390096,"averageDraftPosition":4.113009417451455,"percentChange":-0.4261267494140668,"percentOwned":99.489014924438,"percentStarted":26.429754325609345},"proTeamId":19,"rankings":{"0":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2}],"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":1.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":1.3333333333333333,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":1.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":1.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":2.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":2.6666666666666665,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}]},"seasonOutlook":"Barkley was the second overall pick in the 2018 NFL draft and it's fair to say he'll be the first overall pick in most 2019 fantasy drafts. Barkley was a workhorse as a rookie, racking up 261 carries (second-most among running backs) and 119 targets (third-most), while pacing the position in routes (458), scrimmage yards (2,028) and fantasy points (386). Barkley finished worse than 13th at the position in fantasy points in only two weeks. He was on the field for 83 percent of the Giants' snaps, handled 75 percent of the designed runs and took on 21 percent of the targets.

Rams for four seasons and has seen an uptick in playing time over the past two campaigns. That said, he's still only handling a couple of touches-per-game as a reserve running back. Plus, Los Angeles added Darrell Henderson via the NFL Draft this spring. Brown is a true backup for the Rams and he's not an option for fantasy lineups in Week 1.","2":"That sound you hear is fantasy managers everywhere scrambling to their waiver wires to pick up Brown. The fifth-year back out of Texas outsnapped rookie Darrell Henderson 21-2 and handled five red-zone carries. Todd Gurley II is still the lead back in Los Angeles, but Brown made an impossible to ignore case to be the No. 2. It's a role made even more appealing while watching Gurley appear to be limited due to conitnued injury concerns. Add him if you can and see how he performs in Week 2 against a good Saints defense. Consider using him in future weeks if his role remains consistent.","3":"Brown is an elite handcuff, but his fantasy value when Todd Gurley II is healthy just isn't enough to merit a weekly start. His Week 1 performance -- scoring a pair of touchdowns on 11 carries -- was an outlier and shouldn't be the expectation for a back likely to play on only 20-to-30 snaps per week. Keep him on the bench for Week 3.","4":"Brown is secure in his role as the No. 2 back in Los Angeles, clearly surpassing trendy \"preseason player to watch\" Darrell Henderson as Todd Gurley's handcuff and backup. While his Week 1 touchdowns were nice, it's clear that Brown is strictly the reserve here. This is not a timeshare.

Mattison in the NFL Draft to provide backup to Dalvin Cook. Being next in line behind the oft-injured Cook isn't a bad place to be from a fantasy perspective, but heading into Week 1 it appears the starter is healthy and ready to go. Keep Mattison as a handcuff on your bench rather than in your starting lineup.","2":"Mattison is the obvious No. 2 to Dalvin Cook in Minnesota, but on Sunday we learned that said role doesn't offer a ton of upside. Cook handled over two-thirds of the total snaps and 21 of the team's 32 carries. Mattison got nine of the remaining 11, which is an encouraging sign for his handcuff status. However, he's not going to hold fantasy appeal in Week 2 against a tougher Packers defense.","3":"If you're looking for Dalvin Cook's handcuff, you're in the right place. Mattison has had 13 carries -- 10 more than Ameer Abdullah -- and has done very well when given the chance to carry the ball for Minnesota. He doesn't hold much stand-alone value at this time, so you shouldn't consider him for your Week 3 lineups. Still, pick him up whether or not you roster Cook, just in case something happens to the FSU product.","4":"There may be no more valuable handcuff in fantasy, but that's all Mattison is at this point. He's seeing only around a dozen snaps-per-game and should be kept on the bench as insurance for superstar Dalvin Cook."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":0.043343653250773995,"averageDraftPosition":169.65267016579187,"percentChange":2.8543115026278034,"percentOwned":15.991675400423777,"percentStarted":0.3147000524025427},"proTeamId":16,"rankings":{"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":49,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":50.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}]},"seasonOutlook":"Looking to fill a need after the offseason departure of Latavius Murray, Minnesota selected Mattison with the No. 102 pick in April's draft. Mattison is a big, between-the-tackles back at 5-foot-11, 221 pounds, but also has good receiving and blocking chops. Mattison, who handled a whopping 302 carries at Boise State last season, lacks speed (4.67 YPC) and quickness, but has the size and skill set to settle in as a reliable backup. That's the role he'll play in 2019 as Dalvin Cook's handcuff.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":3.162847701966667,"appliedStats":{"53":3.9643113865,"72":-0.620847536,"24":24.92879241,"25":10.748495243999999,"26":0.13973569,"42":6.290843561,"43":1.9448566619999998,"44":0.030998492,"63":0.015529620000000001},"appliedTotal":47.442715529500006,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":61.96389008,"24":249.2879241,"25":1.791415874,"26":0.069867845,"27":49.0,"28":24.0,"29":12.0,"30":9.0,"31":4.0,"33":12.0,"34":6.0,"35":0.117724888,"36":0.082407422,"37":0.170118544,"38":0.005805493,"39":4.023116105,"40":16.55023563,"42":62.90843561,"43":0.324142777,"44":0.015499246,"45":0.050841756,"46":0.033225088,"47":12.0,"48":6.0,"49":3.0,"50":2.0,"51":1.0,"53":7.928622773,"54":1.0,"56":0.030158128,"57":9.32726E-4,"58":10.55988978,"60":7.934345902,"61":4.17649365,"62":0.085367091,"63":0.00258827,"66":0.583881858,"67":0.074710916,"68":0.658592774,"70":0.268585655,"71":0.041838113,"72":0.310423768,"73":0.310423768,"210":15.0625}},{"appliedStats":{"53":0.5,"24":0.5,"42":0.8},"appliedTotal":1.8,"externalId":"401128093","id":"01401128093","proTeamId":16,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"39":2.5,"40":5.0,"41":1.0,"42":8.0,"47":1.0,"210":1.0,"53":1.0,"23":2.0,"24":5.0,"58":1.0,"59":2.0,"27":1.0,"60":8.0,"156":1.0,"61":8.0}},{"appliedStats":{"24":5.800000000000001,"25":6.0},"appliedTotal":11.8,"externalId":"401127956","id":"01401127956","proTeamId":16,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":12.0,"24":58.0,"25":1.0,"27":11.0,"28":5.0,"29":2.0,"30":2.0,"31":1.0,"33":2.0,"34":1.0,"39":4.833,"40":58.0,"155":1.0,"158":6.0,"180":1.0,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":0.051606391,"72":-0.05310617,"24":2.468967531,"25":0.9516753419999999,"26":0.0075,"42":0.0801279231,"43":0.016352064,"44":3.92984E-4,"63":0.001356},"appliedTotal":3.5248720651,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":6.000263016,"24":24.68967531,"25":0.158612557,"26":0.00375,"27":4.0,"28":2.0,"29":1.0,"33":1.0,"35":0.0116,"36":0.00813,"37":0.0266,"38":9.06E-4,"39":4.11476551,"40":24.68967531,"42":0.801279231,"43":0.002725344,"44":1.96492E-4,"45":0.002628478,"46":0.001717711,"53":0.103212782,"56":4.66514E-4,"57":1.44283E-5,"58":0.140939293,"60":7.763372124,"61":0.801279231,"62":0.003948778,"63":2.26E-4,"66":0.0565,"67":9.72568E-4,"68":0.05751267,"70":0.026,"71":5.44638E-4,"72":0.026553085,"73":0.026553085,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":0.0987223955,"72":-0.05728095,"24":2.6613067000000004,"25":1.080468174,"26":0.01042398,"42":0.1630112981,"43":0.060003498,"44":0.001133762,"63":0.001458},"appliedTotal":4.019246857600001,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":6.367115835,"24":26.613067,"25":0.180078029,"26":0.00521199,"27":5.0,"28":2.0,"29":1.0,"30":1.0,"33":1.0,"35":0.012364333,"36":0.008655033,"37":0.030872827,"38":0.001053571,"39":4.179767997,"40":26.613067,"42":1.630112981,"43":0.010000583,"44":5.66881E-4,"45":0.003289753,"46":0.002149853,"53":0.197444791,"56":8.9899E-4,"57":2.78038E-5,"58":0.269917582,"60":8.256044504,"61":1.630112981,"62":0.005778871,"63":2.43E-4,"66":0.059996934,"67":0.00186051,"68":0.061857444,"70":0.02759859,"71":0.001041886,"72":0.028640475,"73":0.028640475,"210":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":4.1271355727307695,"appliedStats":{"53":0.6441268475,"72":-0.720031908,"24":34.15408886,"25":18.050229324,"26":0.136288946,"42":1.0661835880000001,"43":0.296389296,"44":0.00709499,"63":0.018392501999999998},"appliedTotal":53.6527624455,"externalId":"2019","id":"122019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{"23":81.48895293,"24":341.5408886,"25":3.008371554,"26":0.068144473,"27":68.0,"28":34.0,"29":17.0,"30":13.0,"31":6.0,"33":16.0,"34":8.0,"35":0.158133858,"36":0.110693701,"37":0.392353669,"38":0.013389525,"39":4.191253861,"40":26.27237605,"42":10.66183588,"43":0.049398216,"44":0.003547495,"45":0.043829894,"46":0.028642835,"47":2.0,"48":1.0,"53":1.288253695,"56":0.006198425,"57":1.91704E-4,"58":1.759139097,"60":8.276192746,"61":0.820141222,"62":0.071691968,"63":0.003065417,"66":0.767865303,"67":0.012139134,"68":0.780004437,"70":0.353218039,"71":0.006797915,"72":0.360015954,"73":0.360015954,"210":13.0}},{"appliedAverage":6.400000000000001,"appliedStats":{"24":13.200000000000001,"25":6.0},"appliedTotal":19.200000000000003,"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"33":3.0,"34":1.0,"39":5.28,"40":44.0,"210":3.0,"180":1.0,"23":25.0,"24":132.0,"25":1.0,"27":25.0,"155":2.0,"28":11.0,"156":1.0,"29":5.0,"158":6.0,"30":4.0,"31":1.0}}],"universeId":2},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":44,"totalRanking":186,"totalRat

fantasy monster in 2018, falling 35 scrimmage yards short of 2,000 and piling up 13 touchdowns. There shouldn't be a matchup that scares his fantasy managers. Against the Rams in Week 1, he should be busy once again, even if Cam Newton (foot) plays hobbled. Keep McCaffrey near the top of the RB rankings for the opener.","2":"McCaffrey was too tough to bring down in Week 1, compiling 209 scrimmage yards with two scores. One of the top picks in most fantasy drafts this year, McCaffrey should continue his busy schedule in Week 2 against the Buccaneers, against whom he averaged 159 scrimmage yards across two meetings last year. He's still a surefire fantasy RB1.","3":"The Buccaneers surprisingly tamed McCaffrey in Week 2, and if Panthers QB Cam Newton (foot) has to miss Week 3, that'll certainly be the case again. Fortunately, the Cardinals' light defensive front may be easy for him to run against anyway. McCaffrey won't be a star this week without Newton, but his workload should keep his value close to that of a fantasy RB1 regardless of who is under center.","4":"McCaffrey again dominated backfield work for Carolina, tearing through Arizona's small defensive front and letting Kyle Allen play an effective game under center in Week 3. Cam Newton's (foot) absence seemed to allow the offense to breathe a bit and, though Allen will start again in Week 4 against the Texans, fantasy players should continue riding McCaffrey as a top-end RB1."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":54.38699690402477,"averageDraftPosition":3.8714059504958747,"percentChange":0.017045945662403028,"percentOwned":99.92808859485115,"percentStarted":99.75037486489911},"proTeamId":29,"rankings":{"0":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2}],"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":3.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":2.6666666666666665,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"2":[],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":2.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":2.3333333333333335,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":1.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":1.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}]},"seasonOutlook":"If not for being rested during a meaningless Week 17 game, McCaffrey would've led all backs in fantasy points last season.

He finished 10th among backs in rushing attempts (219) and was first in targets (124), receptions (107) and receiving yards (867). McCaffrey had at least five receiving touchdowns for the second year in a row. He improved his yards per carry from 3.7 to 5.0 and his catch rate from 73 percent to 86 percent.

investment.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":14.001693565624999,"appliedStats":{"53":35.65,"102":0.3798036,"72":-1.862976594,"24":79.32000000000001,"25":31.200000000000003,"26":0.284174716,"42":61.94,"43":16.799999999999997,"44":0.270915328,"63":0.04518},"appliedTotal":224.02709704999998,"externalId":"2018","id":"102018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":198.2,"24":793.2,"25":5.2,"26":0.142087358,"27":158.0,"28":79.0,"29":39.0,"30":31.0,"31":15.0,"32":7.0,"33":39.0,"34":19.0,"35":0.405216929,"36":0.28365185,"37":1.724870399,"38":0.0589,"39":4.0020181634712415,"40":52.66018217,"41":71.3,"42":619.4,"43":2.8,"44":0.135457664,"45":0.067121588,"46":0.043863958,"47":123.0,"48":61.0,"49":30.0,"50":24.0,"51":12.0,"52":6.0,"53":71.3,"54":14.0,"55":7.0,"56":0.765576216,"57":0.023677615,"58":97.0,"60":8.687237026647967,"61":41.12090627,"62":0.277545022,"63":0.00753,"66":1.407956716,"67":0.506836084,"68":1.9,"70":0.647660089,"71":0.283828207,"72":0.931488297,"73":0.931488297,"102":0.0633006,"115":70.62463636,"210":16.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":1.5,"24":15.3,"25":6.0,"42":3.5},"appliedTotal":26.3,"externalId":"401127962","id":"01401127962","proTeamId":29,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":24.0,"24":153.0,"25":1.0,"27":30.0,"28":15.0,"29":7.0,"30":6.0,"31":3.0,"32":1.0,"33":4.0,"34":2.0,"35":1.0,"36":1.0,"37":1.0,"39":6.375,"40":153.0,"41":3.0,"42":35.0,"47":7.0,"48":3.0,"49":1.0,"50":1.0,"53":3.0,"58":4.0,"59":32.0,"60":11.667,"61":35.0,"155":1.0,"158":6.0,"210":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":19.516731677266662,"appliedStats":{"53":46.566397625,"72":-3.102677642,"24":101.77115830000001,"25":43.71889155,"26":0.517095464,"42":76.65622096,"43":26.036926314,"44":0.512192892,"63":0.074769696},"appliedTotal":292.75097515899995,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":225.3433341,"24":1017.711583,"25":7.286481925,"26":0.258547732,"27":203.0,"28":101.0,"29":50.0,"30":40.0,"31":20.0,"33":45.0,"34":22.0,"35":0.467268193,"36":0.327087735,"37":2.857915688,"38":0.097529698,"39":4.516271083,"40":67.56591425,"42":766.5622096,"43":4.339487719,"44":0.256096446,"45":0.081503183,"46":0.05326233,"47":153.0,"48":76.0,"49":38.0,"50":30.0,"51":15.0,"53":93.13279525,"54":18.0,"55":9.0,"56":1.381655479,"57":0.042731613,"58":114.6925555,"60":8.230851523,"61":50.89209691,"62":0.514644178,"63":0.012461616,"66":2.243621745,"67":0.92727289,"68":3.170894634,"70":1.032066002,"71":0.519272818,"72":1.551338821,"73":1.551338821,"210":15.0625}},{"appliedStats":{"53":2.689163091,"72":-0.160249688,"24":7.974989753,"25":3.7500220319999995,"26":0.044788152,"42":4.471984287000001,"43":1.1341922340000001,"44":0.022484394,"63":0.0039120000000000005},"appliedTotal":19.931286255,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":17.7443356,"24":79.74989753,"25":0.625003672,"26":0.022394076,"27":15.0,"28":7.0,"29":3.0,"30":3.0,"31":1.0,"33":3.0,"34":1.0,"35":0.037882137,"36":0.026517496,"37":0.278,"38":0.0095,"39":4.494386226,"40":79.74989753,"42":44.71984287,"43":0.189032039,"44":0.011242197,"45":0.00415516,"46":0.002715397,"47":8.0,"48":4.0,"49":2.0,"50":1.0,"53":5.378326182,"54":1.0,"56":0.071077749,"57":0.002198281,"58":7.000872119,"60":8.314825348,"61":44.71984287,"62":0.033636272,"63":6.52E-4,"66":0.127235494,"67":0.038565208,"68":0.165800702,"70":0.058528327,"71":0.021596516,"72":0.080124844,"73":0.080124844,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":2.9319565705,"72":-0.209217266,"24":8.190643827,"25":3.34615407,"26":0.04122984,"42":4.9051395410000005,"43":1.298050878,"44":0.02544953,"63":0.0050940000000000004},"appliedTotal":20.5345009905,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":18.37010286,"24":81.90643827,"25":0.557692345,"26":0.02061492,"27":16.0,"28":8.0,"29":4.0,"30":3.0,"31":1.0,"33":3.0,"34":1.0,"35":0.039413065,"36":0.027589145,"37":0.293689009,"38":0.010022479,"39":4.458681526,"40":81.90643827,"42":49.05139541,"43":0.216341813,"44":0.012724765,"45":0.003947258,"46":0.002579533,"47":9.0,"48":4.0,"49":2.0,"50":1.0,"53":5.863913141,"54":1.0,"56":0.091486748,"57":0.002829487,"58":7.771903258,"60":8.36495941,"61":49.05139541,"62":0.033339685,"63":8.49E-4,"66":0.163768963,"67":0.052276625,"68":0.216045588,"70":0.075333723,"71":0.02927491,"72":0.104608633,"73":0.104608633,"210":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":19.463329344,"appliedStats":{"53":33.21595536,"72":-2.061668102,"24":104.11230370000001,"25":47.027545542,"26":0.54850339,"42":55.65123526,"43":14.192551764000001,"44":0.286454912,"63":0.05039964599999999},"appliedTotal":253.023281472,"externalId":"2019","id":"122019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{"23":231.649659,"24":1041.123

set the target record this season? These are fun type of questions that become reasonable after posting over 1,400 yards at age 22. The Patriots allowed 18 touchdowns to receivers last season, above league average, setting up Smith-Schuster as a surefire WR1 for Week 1.","2":"Context can matter when considering small samples. For instance, Smith-Schuster's debut as the team's top receiver was seemingly modest, but he was shadowed the entire game by one of the league's top cover talents and still netted six catches, passing Mike Wallace for most receptions by a Steeler within his first three career seasons. The Seahawks were gashed regularly by multiple Bengals receivers in Week 1, setting up Smith-Schuster -- who appears good to go after suffering a toe injury -- for a strong second showing.","3":"Lost in the shuffle of losing Ben Roethlisberger to injury this past week was the fact Smith-Schuster passed Randy Moss as the youngest player (22 years, 297 days) in NFL history to reach 2,500 career receiving yards. There are legitimate questions about Mason Rudolph's ability to sustain WR1 value for Smith-Schuster going forward, but he's still projected to be in the elite mix this week at the position given a choice matchup with an exploitable crew of corners for the 49ers.","4":"A huge touchdown play salvaged his fantasy value in Week 3 and signaled his ninth career game with at least 75 yards and a score in his career. The Bengals have surrendered 14.9 yards per catch to receivers, setting up Smith-Schuster for a strong showing if he can get past their safeties in this one."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":36.6780185758514,"averageDraftPosition":19.716929232308075,"percentChange":-0.01618339820460335,"percentOwned":99.81388261931377,"percentStarted":92.84836488689845},"proTeamId":23,"rankings":{"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":4.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":4.166666666666667,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":6.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":6.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":9.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":7.833333333333333,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":30,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":30,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":30,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":11.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"

is the new main man in Pittsburgh after the Steelers shipped Antonio Brown to Oakland. Smith-Schuster should be able to handle it considering he's fresh off arguably the best second season for a second-year wide receiver in league history. Smith-Schuster paced all wide receivers in pass routes (662) and finished no lower than seventh in targets (167), receptions (111) and receiving yards (1,383). Smith-Schuster has scored seven touchdowns during each of his two NFL seasons, though his 8.3 OTD and 13 end zone targets in 2018 suggest he was a bit unlucky in that department. Smith-Schuster's targets might not rise significantly in 2019, but that's only because he was already a huge part of the offense. Incredibly still only 22, Smith-Schuster's best days still could be ahead of him. He's a solid WR1 with upside to lead the position in fantasy points.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":10.267455882625,"appliedStats":{"53":35.82403151,"101":0.356724,"72":-0.672134268,"42":91.91397309000001,"43":36.29598216,"44":0.546566804,"63":0.014150826},"appliedTotal":164.279294122,"externalId":"2018","id":"102018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"41":71.64806302,"42":919.1397309,"43":6.04933036,"44":0.273283402,"45":0.196618086,"46":0.128489919,"47":183.0,"48":91.0,"49":45.0,"50":36.0,"51":18.0,"52":9.0,"53":71.64806302,"54":14.0,"55":7.0,"56":2.227844598,"57":0.06890241,"58":111.7570373,"60":12.828535652714427,"61":57.44623318,"62":0.273283402,"63":0.002358471,"67":0.600119883,"68":0.600119883,"71":0.336067134,"72":0.336067134,"73":0.336067134,"101":0.059454,"114":222.9525,"210":16.0}},{"appliedAverage":14.298788965374998,"appliedStats":{"53":51.392962,"72":-1.007852432,"42":130.9694628,"43":46.572532314,"44":0.832299872,"63":0.021218892},"appliedTotal":228.78062344599996,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"42":1309.694628,"43":7.762088719,"44":0.416149936,"45":0.237488058,"46":0.155198446,"47":261.0,"48":130.0,"49":65.0,"50":52.0,"51":26.0,"53":102.785924,"54":20.0,"55":10.0,"56":5.021569093,"57":0.155306261,"58":151.8375542,"60":12.74196483,"61":81.85591426,"62":0.416149936,"63":0.003536482,"67":0.899868242,"68":0.899868242,"71":0.503926216,"72":0.503926216,"73":0.503926216,"210":16.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":1.5,"42":8.1,"43":6.0},"appliedTotal":15.6,"externalId":"401127998","id":"01401127998","proTeamId":23,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"41":3.0,"42":81.0,"43":1.0,"45":1.0,"46":1.0,"47":16.0,"48":8.0,"49":4.0,"50":3.0,"51":1.0,"53":3.0,"58":7.0,"59":74.0,"60":27.0,"61":81.0,"108":1.0,"109":1.0,"156":1.0,"158":6.0,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":2.44972989,"72":-0.049020138,"42":6.810513971000001,"43":2.8526097960000003,"44":0.049599202,"63":0.001032},"appliedTotal":12.114464721000001,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"42":68.10513971,"43":0.475434966,"44":0.024799601,"45":0.01714069,"46":0.011201441,"47":13.0,"48":6.0,"49":3.0,"50":2.0,"51":1.0,"53":4.89945978,"56":0.21161293,"57":0.00654473,"58":7.599522933,"60":13.90054063,"61":68.10513971,"62":0.024799601,"63":1.72E-4,"67":0.04376798,"68":0.04376798,"71":0.024510069,"72":0.024510069,"73":0.024510069,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":2.856565991,"72":-0.05732847,"42":7.450535655,"43":1.892780226,"44":0.034010506,"63":0.0012069720000000002},"appliedTotal":12.177770879999999,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"42":74.50535655,"43":0.315463371,"44":0.017005253,"45":0.015289239,"46":0.009991518,"47":14.0,"48":7.0,"49":3.0,"50":2.0,"51":1.0,"53":5.713131982,"54":1.0,"56":0.259196807,"57":0.008016396,"58":8.563894205,"60":13.04107043,"61":74.50535655,"62":0.017005253,"63":2.01162E-4,"67":0.051186134,"68":0.051186134,"71":0.028664235,"72":0.028664235,"73":0.028664235,"210":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":11.868886250538461,"appliedStats":{"53":33.917760285,"72":-0.678708814,"42":91.66774817000001,"43":28.869840678000003,"44":0.504591692,"63":0.014289246},"appliedTotal":154.295521257,"externalId":"2019","id":"122019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{"42":916.6774817,"43":4.811640113,"44":0.252295846,"45":0.202146251,"46":0.132102575,"47":183.0,"48":91.0,"49":45.0,"50":36.0,"51":18.0,"53":67.83552057,"54":13.0,"55":6.0,"56":2.983237053,"57":0.092265063,"58":105.0301017,"60":13.51323722,"61":70.51365244,"62":0.252295846,"63":0.002381541,"67":0.605990012,"68":0.605990012,"71":0.339354407,"72":0.339354407,"73":0.339354407,"210":13.0}},{"appliedAverage":15.087499999999999,"appliedStats":{"53":55.5,"72":-2.0,"24":1.3,"42":142.6,"43":42.0,"44":2.0},"appliedTotal":241.39999999999998,"externalId":"2018","id":"002018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":1.0,"24":13.0,"27":2.0,"28":1.0,"39":13.0,"40":0.8125,"41":111.0,"42":1426.0,"43":7.0,"44":1.0,"45":2.0,"46":2.0,"47":279.0,"48":136.0,"49":63.0,"50":49.0,"51":20.0,"52":8.0,"53":111.0,"54":14.0,"55":3.0,"56":8.0,"58":166.0,"59":100.0,"60":12.846846846846846,"61":89.125,"62":1.0,"67":1.0,"68":1.0,"71":1.0,"72":1.0,"73":1.0,"108":3.0,"109":3.0,"155":9.0,"156":6.0,"157":1.0,"174":0.5625,"210":16.0}},{"appliedAverage":12.433333333333332,"appliedStats":{"53":7.0,"42":24.3,"43":6.0},"appliedTotal":37.3,"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"41":14.0,"42":243.0,"43":1.0,"108":1.0,"109":1.0,"45":1.0,"46":1.0,"47":47.0,"48":23.0,"49":11.0,"50":9.0,"210":3.0,"51":3.0,"53":14.0,"5

Both a high-floor and high-ceiling asset, Brown has posted a minimum of 159 targets, 101 receptions, eight touchdowns and 11 end zone targets during each of the past six seasons. The last season in which he didn't finish as a top 5 fantasy wide receiver was 2012. Brown's touchdowns figure to take a dive this season after he found the end zone a career-high 15 times last season despite a 9.6 OTD. In the five previous seasons, Brown averaged 10.4 scores per season (9.0 OTD) and he figures to be in that range in 2019 once he finds a home. The 31-year-old receiver is now in New England and, while he figures to see a dip in targets, he'll get enough in a Patriots' high-scoring offense that another Top 10 fantasy campaign is possible. Consider him a fringe WR1.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":17.761713902666667,"appliedStats":{"53":55.45,"102":1.70107803,"72":-1.629457688,"42":158.49,"43":51.599999999999994,"44":0.779782292,"63":0.034305906},"appliedTotal":266.42570854,"externalId":"2018","id":"102018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"41":110.9,"42":1584.9,"43":8.6,"44":0.389891146,"45":0.315184928,"46":0.20597335,"47":316.0,"48":158.0,"49":79.0,"50":63.0,"51":31.0,"52":15.0,"53":110.9,"54":22.0,"55":11.0,"56":6.717383515,"57":0.207754129,"58":170.6,"60":14.291253381424706,"61":99.05540715,"62":0.389891146,"63":0.005717651,"67":1.454872935,"68":1.5,"71":0.814728844,"72":0.814728844,"73":0.814728844,"102":0.283513005,"115":160.7634286,"210":15.0}},{"appliedAverage":13.099968626,"appliedStats":{"53":39.98229116,"72":-0.682083872,"42":103.1703646,"43":53.617177332,"44":0.39744017,"63":0.014340000000000002},"appliedTotal":196.49952939000002,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"42":1031.703646,"43":8.936196222,"44":0.198720085,"45":0.175345627,"46":0.114588367,"47":206.0,"48":103.0,"49":51.0,"50":41.0,"51":20.0,"53":79.96458232,"54":15.0,"55":7.0,"56":3.252052139,"57":0.100578932,"58":127.0298996,"60":12.90200756,"61":68.78024305,"62":0.198720085,"63":0.00239,"67":0.609003456,"68":0.609003456,"71":0.341041936,"72":0.341041936,"73":0.341041936,"210":15.0}},{"appliedStats":{},"appliedTotal":0.0,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{}},{"appliedStats":{},"appliedTotal":0.0,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{}},{"appliedAverage":12.908886939214284,"appliedStats":{"53":34.71910658,"72":-0.79775899,"24":2.477653139,"25":0.836875056,"26":0.004002198,"42":94.73159144,"43":48.36658928999999,"44":0.369390166,"63":0.01696827},"appliedTotal":180.72441714899998,"externalId":"2019","id":"122019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{"23":4.194110457,"24":24.77653139,"25":0.139479176,"26":0.002001099,"27":4.0,"28":2.0,"29":1.0,"35":0.007713068,"36":0.005399148,"37":0.001756607,"38":5.99E-5,"39":5.907458005,"40":1.769752242,"42":947.3159144,"43":8.061098215,"44":0.184695083,"45":0.21537012,"46":0.140744374,"47":189.0,"48":94.0,"49":47.0,"50":37.0,"51":18.0,"53":69.43821316,"54":13.0,"55":6.0,"56":2.924179223,"57":0.090438533,"58":108.8540773,"60":13.64257332,"61":67.66542246,"62":0.186696182,"63":0.002828045,"66":0.040988787,"67":0.678615451,"68":0.719604238,"70":0.018854842,"71":0.380024652,"72":0.398879495,"73":0.398879495,"210":14.0}},{"appliedAverage":18.113333333333337,"appliedStats":{"53":52.0,"42":129.70000000000002,"43":90.0},"appliedTotal":271.70000000000005,"externalId":"2018","id":"002018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":1.0,"2":1.0,"41":104.0,"42":1297.0,"43":15.0,"45":4.0,"46":2.0,"47":254.0,"48":123.0,"49":58.0,"50":44.0,"51":19.0,"52":5.0,"53":104.0,"54":16.0,"55":2.0,"56":5.0,"58":168.0,"59":112.0,"60":12.471153846153847,"61":81.0625,"108":3.0,"109":3.0,"155":9.0,"156":6.0,"157":1.0,"174":0.5625,"210":15.0}},{"appliedAverage":14.100000000000001,"appliedStats":{"53":2.0,"24":0.5,"42":5.6000000000000005,"43":6.0},"appliedTotal":14.100000000000001,"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"39":5.0,"40":5.0,"41":4.0,"42":56.0,"43":1.0,"47":11.0,"48":5.0,"49":2.0,"50":2.0,"210":1.0,"51":1.0,"53":4.0,"23":1.0,"24":5.0,"185":1.0,"58":8.0,"27":1.0,"59":7.0,"155":1.0,"60":14.0,"61":56.0,"158":6.0}}],"universeId":0},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":79,"totalRanking":227,"totalRating":14.1}},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"ONTEAM","tradeLocked":false},"status":"NORMAL"},{"acquisitionDate":1566789842874,"acquisitionType":"DRAFT","injuryStatus":"NORMAL","lineupSlotId":4,"pendingTransactionIds":null,"playerId":12649,"playerPoolEntry":{"appliedStatTotal":20.7,"id":12649,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":4,"lineupLocked":true,"onTeamId":2,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":3,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":20,"published":false,"rank":40,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},"PPR":{"auctionValue":21,"published":false,"rank":39,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[3,4,5,23,7,20,21],"firstName":"Julian","fullName":"Julian Edelman","id":12649,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","lastName":"Edelman","lastNewsDate":1569793440000,"lastVideoDate":1568912272000,"outlooks":{"outlooksByWeek":{"1":"Tom Brady could look Edelman's way early and often in Sunday's marquee matchup with the Steelers. Pittsburgh allowed the 13th-most yards to receivers last season and could struggle to contain Edelman underneath in space. As the top target in a Brady offense, Edelman is a high-end WR2 for Week 1.","2":"Edelman became the fifth Patriots player to ever compile 500 catches with the franchise thanks to another textbook six-catch showing. There is now clearly increased competition for targets now that Antonio Brown is in the fold, but the guess would be the pie is big enough to satiate the top targets in this offense, especially facing a suspect Miami defense that saw the Ravens play catch in Week 1.","3":"We'll see Edelman's target share naturally dip in the weeks ahead now that Antonio Brown and Josh Gordon are members of the depth chart. This doesn't mean Edelman still isn't a high-floor flex option in PPR formats facing a soft Jets pass defense, because he is, but rather the ceiling is a bit lower now that there are so many talented peers to contend with.","4":"The seven catches Edelman netted in the first half of Week 3 are tied for the most of his career in a single half. Unfortunately, Edelman left the game in the second quarter with a rib injury, but tests after the game revealed no fractures. Assuming he's good to go for this division matchup, Edelman is a high-floor option in PPR formats facing a Bills team that has allowed the third-most receptions to receivers."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":16.424148606811144,"averageDraftPosition":45.275962660443405,"percentChange":0.10592356804446013,"percentOwned":99.06159309879331,"percentStarted":81.33396178590652},"proTeamId":17,"rankings":{"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":12.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":11.166666666666666,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":17,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":17,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":17,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":22,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":20,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":17.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":16.833333333333332,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":21,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":22,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":20,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":20,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":23,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":20.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":16.333333333333332,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRan

was suspended for the first four games of the 2018 season but still managed a 74/850/6 line during 12 regular-season games. Tom Brady's top target was limited to one top 10 fantasy week but finished only one of 12 outings worse than 30th, making him the second-safest bet for a top-30 week behind only Davante Adams. Edelman is averaging a massive 9.4 targets per game over the past five seasons and reached eight targets in nine of 12 games in 2018. Durability is the notable drawback as he has missed 45 of 160 possible regular-season games (28 percent) since joining the team in 2009. Edelman is now 33, but following Rob Gronkowski's retirement, he's ticketed for a gigantic offensive role. Consider him a strong WR2

additional speed on the outside of the offense help Watson's case as the best fantasy play at the position for this first week of the 2019 season. Watson is the rare quarterback capable of rushing for 100 yards one week while throwing five touchdowns the next. In Week 1, Watson is in the Superdome to face a Saints defense that allowed the most yards to receivers last season.","2":"The hurry to get a competent line together for Watson late this offseason didn't result in better protection for the star signal-caller. He was sacked six times in New Orleans in Week 1. Then again, it didn't harm Watson's fantasy production, as the unique dual-threat talent produced four total scores with strong yardage results. The Jaguars come to town, fresh from surrendering 40 points to the Chiefs, with Watson poised as a top option once again in Week 2.","3":"Watson failed to throw a touchdown for just the third game in his career but did deliver his ninth career rushing score, breaking a tie with David Carr for the most rushing scores by a Houston quarterback. The offensive line continues to struggle—Watson has been sacked 10 times this season, including four in Week 2—which could be an issue against a dangerous Chargers pass rush. Then again, the point total for this game is approaching 50 and, with Watson as the centerpiece of the Houston offense, there's still an awesome ceiling in place.","4":"The Panthers are allowing just 13.5 fantasy points per game to opposing passers this season, eighth fewest in the league. Even with a tough matchup ahead, we're talking about Watson, who just became the first Texans quarterback since 2014 with at least 350 passing yards, three scores and zero interceptions in a game. On the fast field in Houston, Watson remains a must-start option under center."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":6.622291021671827,"averageDraftPosition":39.58349312213422,"percentChange":0.023534574478759396,"percentOwned":99.50321514133411,"percentStarted":84.31910768670491},"proTeamId":34,"rankings":{"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":1.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":1.1666666666666667,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":5.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":5.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":5.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":5.666666666666667,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":2.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":3.3333333333333335,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}]},"seasonOutlook":"Watson picked up where he left off during an injury-shortened rookie season with a terrific sophomore campaign. The Clemson product was fantasy's No. 4 QB and his 10 top-10 fantasy weeks ranked third. Despite dealing with overwhelming pressure due to a weak offensive line (league-high 62 sacks), Watson ranked top 12 in passing yards (4,165) and touchdowns (26). He added 551 yards and five scores on 99 carries, all of which ranked third at the position.

running backs in receiving yardage since he entered the league in 2015, Johnson will be busy in his debut with the Texans in a game bound that should prove rewarding for fantasy managers. The Saints were stingy against the run last season but exploitable against the pass. Johnson has solid flex value for this trip to New Orleans.","2":"Johnson's debut with the Texans was ultimately positive given he tallied 90 scrimmage yards on his 13 touches. Johnson will need to see more work in the passing phase to really erupt as a fantasy weapon, especially with Carlos Hyde likely to consume a heavy does of carries. The Jaguars have allowed just the seventh-fewest receiving yards to tailbacks since the start of last season. Given his talents as a receiver, Johnson enters Week 2 as a solid flex option.","3":"With a robust target rate of 20% per route run, Johnson brings some upside to the field in PPR formats against the Chargers this week. Aiding Johnson's cause as a flex option in PPR leagues is the fact the Chargers have allowed 1,030 receiving yards to tailbacks over the past 18 games, the most in the NFL.","4":"Johnson, who had just four touches in Week 3, is not living up to the lofty expectations placed on him entering the season.

has emerged as one of the league's best receiving backs since he was drafted in the third round of the 2015 draft. He ranks third at the position in targets (297), third in receptions (235), first in receiving yards (2170) and 11th in touchdown catches (eight) the past four seasons. Despite the success, Johnson had career lows in carries (40) and targets (62) last season. Fantasy's No. 11 scoring back in 2017 plummeted to a career-worst 37th in 2018. A bounceback figures to be in the cards in 2019 as Johnson was traded to Houston where he'll play a major role following Lamar Miller's torn ACL. Johnson figures to be limited a bit as a rusher, but will certainly be very busy as Houston's primary receiving back. He's in the RB2 mix.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":8.517182725187501,"appliedStats":{"53":29.664079555,"72":-1.71118192,"24":31.862694720000004,"25":12.118569114,"26":0.097073962,"42":54.23408838,"43":9.846787812,"44":0.122778114,"63":0.040033866},"appliedTotal":136.27492360300002,"externalId":"2018","id":"102018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":75.67973491,"24":318.6269472,"25":2.019761519,"26":0.048536981,"27":63.0,"28":31.0,"29":15.0,"30":12.0,"31":6.0,"32":3.0,"33":15.0,"34":7.0,"35":0.144875936,"36":0.101413155,"37":0.276927692,"38":0.00945048,"39":4.2102016818494175,"40":21.15365625,"41":59.32815911,"42":542.3408838,"43":1.641131302,"44":0.061389057,"45":0.101376362,"46":0.066249453,"47":108.0,"48":54.0,"49":27.0,"50":21.0,"51":10.0,"52":5.0,"53":59.32815911,"54":11.0,"55":5.0,"56":0.531114609,"57":0.016426225,"58":77.18515405,"60":9.14137387601137,"61":36.00603378,"62":0.109926037,"63":0.006672311,"66":0.951708969,"67":0.74608006,"68":1.697789029,"70":0.437786126,"71":0.417804834,"72":0.85559096,"73":0.85559096,"210":16.0}},{"appliedAverage":10.925854737066667,"appliedStats":{"53":26.40319652,"72":-2.139279928,"24":64.28522853,"25":14.72114613,"26":0.152853492,"42":47.28590693,"43":12.968963472,"44":0.157935382,"63":0.051870528},"appliedTotal":163.887821056,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":148.3510571,"24":642.8522853,"25":2.453524355,"26":0.076426746,"27":128.0,"28":64.0,"29":32.0,"30":25.0,"31":12.0,"33":29.0,"34":14.0,"35":0.295458835,"36":0.206821184,"37":1.13,"38":0.0387,"39":4.333317862,"40":42.6789899,"42":472.8590693,"43":2.161493912,"44":0.078967691,"45":0.104012291,"46":0.067972032,"47":94.0,"48":47.0,"49":23.0,"50":18.0,"51":9.0,"53":52.80639304,"54":10.0,"55":5.0,"56":0.370100374,"57":0.011446403,"58":66.92847821,"60":8.954579968,"61":31.39313323,"62":0.155394437,"63":0.008645088,"66":1.622300836,"67":0.577467106,"68":2.199767941,"70":0.746258384,"71":0.323381579,"72":1.069639964,"73":1.069639964,"210":15.0625}},{"appliedStats":{"53":1.211531095,"72":-0.087858048,"24":2.462852702,"25":0.78,"26":0.0078,"42":2.190887019,"43":0.590003262,"44":0.007221072,"63":0.002112},"appliedTotal":7.1645491020000005,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":5.504275025,"24":24.62852702,"25":0.13,"26":0.0039,"27":4.0,"28":2.0,"29":1.0,"33":1.0,"35":0.0106,"36":0.00743,"37":0.0264,"38":9.02E-4,"39":4.474436126,"40":24.62852702,"42":21.90887019,"43":0.098333877,"44":0.003610536,"45":0.006520161,"46":0.004260925,"47":4.0,"48":2.0,"49":1.0,"53":2.42306219,"56":0.011146618,"57":3.44741E-4,"58":3.092905599,"60":9.041810927,"61":21.90887019,"62":0.007512223,"63":3.52E-4,"66":0.0622,"67":0.027371048,"68":0.089547651,"70":0.0286,"71":0.015327787,"72":0.043929024,"73":0.043929024,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":1.553308084,"72":-0.112984596,"24":3.144930345,"25":0.78257385,"26":0.008529954,"42":2.842533329,"43":0.552715098,"44":0.00670311,"63":0.002718},"appliedTotal":8.781027174,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":7.037855439,"24":31.44930345,"25":0.130428975,"26":0.004264977,"27":6.0,"28":3.0,"29":1.0,"30":1.0,"33":1.0,"35":0.013746916,"36":0.009622841,"37":0.043155302,"38":0.001472725,"39":4.46859185,"40":31.44930345,"42":28.42533329,"43":0.092119183,"44":0.003351555,"45":0.006628386,"46":0.004331651,"47":5.0,"48":2.0,"49":1.0,"50":1.0,"53":3.106616168,"56":0.020706615,"57":6.4E-4,"58":3.997695981,"60":9.149934126,"61":28.42533329,"62":0.007616532,"63":4.53E-4,"66":0.079882491,"67":0.035261344,"68":0.115143835,"70":0.036745946,"71":0.019746352,"72":0.056492298,"73":0.056492298,"210":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":7.033340727076923,"appliedStats":{"53":16.37810123,"72":-1.121197634,"24":30.33300286,"25":8.742648708,"26":0.090314294,"42":29.94209848,"43":6.956931323999999,"44":0.084690138,"63":0.026840052},"appliedTotal":91.433429452,"externalId":"2019","id":"122019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{"23":68.00947782,"24":303.3300286,"25":1.457108118,"26":0.045157147,"27":60.0,"28":30.0,"29":15.0,"30":12.0,"31":6.0,"33":13.0,"34":6.0,"35":0.130788656,"36":0.091552059,"37":0.310024845,"38":0.010579959,"39":4.460114066,"40":23.33307913,"42":299.4209848,"43":1.159488554,"44":0.042345069,"45":0.088960962,"46":0.058135988,"47":59.0,"48":29.0,"49":14.0,"50":11.0,"51":5.0,"53":32.75620246,"54":6.0,"55":3.0,"56":0.162240561,"57":0.005017749,"58":41.81145007,"60":9.140894315,"61":23.03238345,"62":0.087502217,"63":0.004473342,"66":0.768238916,"67":0.37001592,"68":1.138254836,"70":0.353389902,"71":0.207208915,"72":0.560598817,"73":0.560598817,"210":13.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":1.0,"24":0.2,"42":2.2},"appliedTotal":3.40000000000

had a breakout season in 2015 which seemed to predict a career as a top-tier NFL receiver, but Robinson has struggled to stay healthy and consistent ever since. He saw a healthy share of targets last season and found the end zone four times, but fantasy managers can't help but expect a bit more out of the Penn State product. He'll face the Packers in Week 1, a team that held him in check last year, but on volume and role alone he's worthy of a spot as your WR3 or flex.","2":"Robinson was the star of the show for the Bears in Week 1, hauling in 7-of-13 targets for 102 yards in what was an otherwise disappointing day for the Chicago offense. That's healthy volume and efficiency in what was a poor day for his team, so there's reason for optimism in what should be an easier matchup with the Broncos in Week 2. Denver allowed Tyerll Williams to break out for 105 yards and a touchdown in Week 1. Consider Robinson as a solid WR2 for the week ahead.","3":"The Bears' offense has yet to kick into gear this season, with a pair of tough matchups out of the gate. That all changes in Week 3, as  Chicago heads to Washington, a team that offers less resistance to the pass game. DeSean Jackson hauled in a pair of touchdowns in Week 1 -- two of the six passing scores allowed by the Washington defense across two games. Robinson is the receiver with by far the most targets on the Chicago offense, so he stands to benefit from what should be a breakout game for the entire Bears offense. He's a borderline WR2 and definitely worthy of a spot in your flex.","4":"While quarterback Mitchell Trubisky had a breakout game in Week 3, Robinson couldn't say the same about his lackluster 60 yards. With all three of Chicago's TD passes going to Taylor Gabriel, the Penn State product was left with a disappointing fantasy point total. Still, he saw seven targets and is now up to 27 on the season through three games. Plus, he's absolutely the best receiver on the Bears. He'll face a tough test as Chicago hosts Minnesota in Week 4, however, so downgrade him to more of a flex pick."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":8.462848297213622,"averageDraftPosition":82.08884814135689,"percentChange":-1.708012364122368,"percentOwned":91.32545681346973,"percentStarted":34.786032444009024},"proTeamId":3,"rankings":{"0":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":28,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4}],"1":[],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":24,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":21,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":21,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":21,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":21,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":24,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":23,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":24,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":22.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":22.166666666666668,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":24,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":26,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":23,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":28,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":23,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":20,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":27,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":27,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":23.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":26.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":30,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":29,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":33,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":29,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":62,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":28,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":30,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":29,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":33,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":62,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":30,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":62,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":34,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":30.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":30.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":62,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23}]},"seasonOutlook":"It's fair to say Robinson's first season with Chicago was a bit of a disappointment. The former Jaguar missed three games because of injury and was held to one weekly finish fantasy better than 19th. Robinson was held to four touchdowns, though he did enjoy a healthy 23 percent target share. The latter supplies some promise as Robinson is still only 25 and enters 2019 with a full season under his belt after missing all but three snaps in 2017 because of a torn ACL. Robinson ranked seventh at the position in targets (297) and fourth in touchdowns (20) during the 2015-16 seasons.

The 23-year-old is a fringe TE1 with upside.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":6.610383619,"appliedStats":{"53":22.37917542,"72":-0.594367544,"42":52.014240040000004,"43":31.561046496,"44":0.393529934,"63":0.012513558000000001},"appliedTotal":105.766137904,"externalId":"2018","id":"102018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"41":44.75835084,"42":520.1424004,"43":5.260174416,"44":0.196764967,"45":0.114027066,"46":0.074516688,"47":104.0,"48":52.0,"49":26.0,"50":20.0,"51":10.0,"52":5.0,"53":44.75835084,"54":8.0,"55":4.0,"56":0.474093697,"57":0.014662692,"58":72.03947711,"60":11.621125234470325,"61":32.50890002,"62":0.196764967,"63":0.002085593,"67":0.530685306,"68":0.530685306,"71":0.297183772,"72":0.297183772,"73":0.297183772,"210":16.0}},{"appliedStats":{},"appliedTotal":0.0,"externalId":"401128018","id":"01401128018","proTeamId":5,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{}},{"appliedAverage":7.562529581437501,"appliedStats":{"53":26.208767155,"72":-0.556862002,"42":62.497369760000005,"43":32.189739270000004,"44":0.649735186,"63":0.011723934000000002},"appliedTotal":121.00047330300002,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"42":624.9736976,"43":5.364956545,"44":0.324867593,"45":0.151946984,"46":0.099297354,"47":124.0,"48":62.0,"49":31.0,"50":24.0,"51":12.0,"53":52.41753431,"54":10.0,"55":5.0,"56":0.784993088,"57":0.024278137,"58":80.89742748,"60":11.92298924,"61":39.0608561,"62":0.324867593,"63":0.001953989,"67":0.497198216,"68":0.497198216,"71":0.278431001,"72":0.278431001,"73":0.278431001,"210":16.0}},{"appliedStats":{},"appliedTotal":0.0,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{}},{"appliedStats":{},"appliedTotal":0.0,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{}},{"appliedAverage":0.0,"appliedStats":{},"appliedTotal":0.0,"externalId":"2019","id":"122019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{}},{"appliedAverage":7.24375,"appliedStats":{"53":28.0,"42":63.900000000000006,"43":24.0},"appliedTotal":115.9,"externalId":"2018","id":"002018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"41":56.0,"42":639.0,"43":4.0,"47":122.0,"48":58.0,"49":24.0,"50":19.0,"51":8.0,"53":56.0,"54":4.0,"58":88.0,"59":55.0,"60":11.410714285714286,"61":39.9375,"108":2.0,"109":2.0,"155":7.0,"156":8.0,"157":1.0,"174":0.4375,"210":16.0}},{"appliedStats":{},"appliedTotal":0.0,"externalId":"401128125","id":"01401128125","proTeamId":5,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{}},{"appliedAverage":5.85,"appliedStats":{"53":2.0,"42":3.7,"43":6.0},"appliedTotal":11.7,"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"41":4.0,"42":37.0,"43":1.0,"47":7.0,"48":3.0,"49":1.0,"50":1.0,"210":2.0,"53":4.0,"183":1.0,"58":6.0,"59":14.0,"155":1.0,"60":9.25,"156":1.0,"61":18.5,"158":6.0}}],"universeId":1},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":28,"totalRanking":254,"totalRating":11.7}},"rosterLocked":true,"status":"ONTEAM","tradeLocked":false},"status":"NORMAL"},{"acquisitionDate":1566789842875,"acquisitionType":"DRAFT","injuryStatus":"NORMAL","lineupSlotId":20,"pendingTransactionIds":null,"playerId":3912550,"playerPoolEntry":{"appliedStatTotal":27.3,"id":3912550,"keeperValue":5,"keeperValueFuture":13,"lineupLocked":true,"onTeamId":2,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":2,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":2,"published":false,"rank":124,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},"PPR":{"auctionValue":1,"published":false,"rank":172,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[2,3,23,7,20,21],"firstName":"Ronald","fullName":"Ronald Jones II","id":3912550,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","lastName":"Jones II","lastNewsDate":1569803912000,"lastVideoDate":1569361494000,"outlooks":{"outlooksByWeek":{"1":"Jones is stuck between presumed starter Peyton Barber and preseason star Dare Ogunbowale for backfield work, and his struggles in pass protection won't do him any favors. He's best considered a desperation flex play against the 49ers in Week 1, and it looks like he'll be stuck in a committee for some time.","2":"Jones took the spotlight as Jameis Winston struggled in Week 1. Jones may lead Tampa Bay's backfield after his 93-yard day from scrimmage, but he'll still have to give up some work to both Peyton Barber and Dare Ogunbowale. The Panthers allowed 150 yards and two touchdowns to Rams backup Malcolm Brown, so Tampa Bay could have some room to generate a surprise fantasy day. Jones looks like a high-end fantasy flex for Week 2.","3":"Jones logged just four touches in a sloppy Week 2 win as the Buccaneers rode Peyton Barber. They simply didn't need Jones' receiving services in this one. Against the Giants, Barber should be the lead back again, though New York has allowed three ground scores to running backs so far, which may leave Jones room to contribute in garbage time. He's an OK dice roll at the flex spot for Week 3 fantasy lineups.","4":"Jones took the backfield lead during a high-scoring Week 3 clash with the Giants and could be poised to outwork Peyton Barber again in Week 4, when the Buccaneers probably will need to keep a frantic pace to try and match the Rams. Jones is a solid flex play due to his big-play ability. He's averaged at least 5.7 YPC in two of his three games so far this year.

Jones is undersized at 5-foot-11, 205 pounds, which might limit his early-down and goal-line opportunities, but the depth chart is wide open in Tampa Bay. He's a post-hype sleeper with tons of raw talent and upside as a receiver.

leadership don't show up in the box score, which certainly curbs Gore's appeal for this meeting with the solid front-seven of the Jets. At this stage, Gore is likely third in fantasy value among the Bills' trio of tailbacks.","2":"Sure, Gore led the Bills with 11 touches in a Week 1 win over the Jets, but he was held to just 1.82 yards per rush and ran just one route. Even as the Giants present an inviting matchup—New York allowed the fourth-most rushing scores (15) to tailbacks last season—Gore's uninspired role and lack of playmaking ability mean he's not a starting fantasy option.","3":"In a solid showing against the lowly Giants' defense, Gore became just the fifth running back at least 36-years old with a rushing score in the Super Bowl era. The Bengals, third worst in rushing defense, actually have been worse than the Giants in defefening opposing backfields over the past 18 games..","4":"In a vintage performance, Gore rumbled for 89 yards from scrimmage for the Bills in Week 3.

joins the Bills as a complement to rookie Devin Singletary after a bizarre 2018 season in Miami, during which he averaged a healthy 4.6 YPC (2.3 YAC), but failed to rush for a single touchdown. Gore finished 46th at the position in fantasy points, which is the first time he has finished a season worse than 21st since 2006. He also missed a game for the first time since 2010. Now 36 years old, Gore won't see enough volume to allow consistent fantasy production. Even if Singletary were to miss time, Gore would share touches with TJ Yeldon. There's little fantasy appeal here.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":5.847948416857143,"appliedStats":{"53":9.96793677,"72":-1.152094498,"24":41.59229147,"25":10.879026054,"26":0.120334908,"42":16.35397006,"43":4.032076014,"44":0.049188578,"63":0.028548479999999998},"appliedTotal":81.871277836,"externalId":"2018","id":"102018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":106.2888847,"24":415.9229147,"25":1.813171009,"26":0.060167454,"27":83.0,"28":41.0,"29":20.0,"30":16.0,"31":8.0,"32":4.0,"33":21.0,"34":10.0,"35":0.206966178,"36":0.144876324,"37":0.475334624,"38":0.016221347,"39":3.913136504103331,"40":27.61313956,"41":19.93587354,"42":163.5397006,"43":0.672012669,"44":0.024594289,"45":0.047650942,"46":0.03113989,"47":32.0,"48":16.0,"49":8.0,"50":6.0,"51":3.0,"52":1.0,"53":19.93587354,"54":3.0,"55":1.0,"56":0.061864339,"57":0.00191333,"58":27.92464645,"60":8.20328741912756,"61":10.85740751,"62":0.084761743,"63":0.00475808,"66":1.019488885,"67":0.191218504,"68":1.210707388,"70":0.468964887,"71":0.107082362,"72":0.576047249,"73":0.576047249,"210":14.0}},{"appliedAverage":6.6690322349999995,"appliedStats":{"53":8.270764775,"72":-1.311506896,"24":64.17139403,"25":11.616142008,"26":0.11261077,"42":13.78360593,"43":3.2941708199999997,"44":0.065419472,"63":0.032882616},"appliedTotal":100.03548352499999,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":145.0234003,"24":641.7139403,"25":1.936023668,"26":0.056305385,"27":128.0,"28":64.0,"29":32.0,"30":25.0,"31":12.0,"33":29.0,"34":14.0,"35":0.288415043,"36":0.20189053,"37":1.136262419,"38":0.038776277,"39":4.424899284,"40":42.60341512,"42":137.8360593,"43":0.54902847,"44":0.032709736,"45":0.048215171,"46":0.031508614,"47":27.0,"48":13.0,"49":6.0,"50":5.0,"51":2.0,"53":16.54152955,"54":3.0,"55":1.0,"56":0.053954659,"57":0.001668701,"58":23.44579142,"60":8.332727568,"61":9.150941693,"62":0.089015121,"63":0.005480436,"66":1.251738344,"67":0.142774661,"68":1.394513005,"70":0.575799638,"71":0.07995381,"72":0.655753448,"73":0.655753448,"210":15.0625}},{"appliedStats":{"24":10.9},"appliedTotal":10.9,"externalId":"401127866","id":"01401127866","proTeamId":2,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"32":1.0,"33":3.0,"34":1.0,"37":1.0,"39":6.412,"40":109.0,"210":1.0,"23":17.0,"24":109.0,"58":1.0,"27":21.0,"28":10.0,"156":1.0,"29":5.0,"30":4.0,"31":2.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":0.842282918,"72":-0.136740118,"24":5.326507339,"25":1.8789996059999998,"26":0.01576,"42":1.3274873360000001,"43":0.285619254,"44":0.00647312,"63":0.0034260000000000002},"appliedTotal":9.549815455000001,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":14.07183324,"24":53.26507339,"25":0.313166601,"26":0.00788,"27":10.0,"28":5.0,"29":2.0,"30":2.0,"31":1.0,"33":2.0,"34":1.0,"35":0.0292,"36":0.0204,"37":0.124,"38":0.00423,"39":3.785226308,"40":53.26507339,"42":13.27487336,"43":0.047603209,"44":0.00323656,"45":0.003490415,"46":0.002280986,"47":2.0,"48":1.0,"53":1.684565836,"56":0.004977319,"57":1.54E-4,"58":2.16618027,"60":7.88029359,"61":13.27487336,"62":0.011116419,"63":5.71E-4,"66":0.13,"67":0.015529619,"68":0.14525456,"70":0.0597,"71":0.008696586,"72":0.068370059,"73":0.068370059,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":0.6269503815,"72":-0.15931355,"24":7.165366834,"25":2.382268326,"26":0.01962,"42":1.072112925,"43":0.29941757999999996,"44":0.00666034,"63":0.004026},"appliedTotal":11.4171088365,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":17.09535329,"24":71.65366834,"25":0.397044721,"26":0.00981,"27":14.0,"28":7.0,"29":3.0,"30":2.0,"31":1.0,"33":3.0,"34":1.0,"35":0.0363,"36":0.0254,"37":0.225,"38":0.00767,"39":4.191411965,"40":71.65366834,"42":10.72112925,"43":0.04990293,"44":0.00333017,"45":0.004853742,"46":0.003171921,"47":2.0,"48":1.0,"53":1.253900763,"56":0.004026359,"57":1.24527E-4,"58":1.619231721,"60":8.550221488,"61":10.72112925,"62":0.013135795,"63":6.71E-4,"66":0.159,"67":0.011660185,"68":0.170632078,"70":0.0731,"71":0.006529703,"72":0.079656775,"73":0.079656775,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":1.0,"24":7.6000000000000005,"25":6.0,"42":1.3},"appliedTotal":15.900000000000002,"externalId":"401127915","id":"01401127915","proTeamId":2,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":14.0,"24":76.0,"25":1.0,"27":15.0,"28":7.0,"29":3.0,"30":3.0,"31":1.0,"33":2.0,"34":1.0,"39":5.429,"40":76.0,"41":2.0,"42":13.0,"47":2.0,"48":1.0,"53":2.0,"58":2.0,"59":17.0,"60":6.5,"61":13.0,"155":1.0,"158":6.0,"179":1.0,"210":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":9.476170387692308,"appliedStats":{"53":7.79088867,"72":-1.774122556,"24":75.20487232,"25":25.8300912,"26":0.217633774,"42":12.69886085,"43":3.10866342,"44":0.068592166,"63":0.044735196000000005},"appliedTotal":123.19021

league's most prolific scoring threats on vertical targets, but he has had durability issues. Healthy heading into the new season, Fuller projects as a worthy big-play option against a New Orleans defense that yielded the most yards in the league to wideouts in 2018.","2":"A crowded and competitive depth chart at receiver left Fuller with just four targets in Week 1. These weren't just any targets, however, as Fuller's average target travelled 35.7 air yards, leading him to 69 yards on his two catches. We'd like to see more opportunities for this gifted deep threat, but he has almost sole claim of the Texans' valuable vertical work. In additon, the Chiefs beat the Jaguars deep several times this past week. Fuller is a high-ceiling, low-floor flex candidate.","3":"An awesome vertical threat averaging a team-high 23.8 air yards per target through two weeks, the counter to Fuller's big-play upside is that he has a catch on just 9% of his routes this year.  ","4":"Fuller leads the Texans in routes run but, with just 5.6 targets per game, he's only had a reception on 10.8% of his routes (team average is 12.8). This puts pressure on him to hit on big plays when he does connect with Deshaun Watson. It makes sense, then, that Fuller has a team-best 18 air yards per target. The Panthers were susceptible to the big play last season, and Fuller is the quintessential boom-or-bust deep threat."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":0.7987616099071208,"averageDraftPosition":143.9107276819205,"percentChange":-6.803620640159863,"percentOwned":68.13309495685657,"percentStarted":8.488708801204128},"proTeamId":34,"rankings":{"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":40,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":45,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":41,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":45,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":29,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":32,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":31,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":47,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":35,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":27,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":40.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":35.166666666666664,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":47,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":43,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":38,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":43,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":36,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":46,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":43,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":40,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":47.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":42.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":45,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":43,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":47,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":43,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":45,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":47,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":47,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":45,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":48,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":38,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":45.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":44.666666666666664,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":46,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":47,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":47,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":45,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":50,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":49,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":33,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":46.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":47.166666666666664,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}]},"seasonOutlook":"Fuller has certainly flashed the upside that made him a first-round draft pick back in 2016, but he has yet to finish a season as a top-60 fantasy wide receiver. Durability has been the obvious issue, as Fuller has missed at least two games during each of his three seasons, including six in 2017 and nine in 2018. Last season, Fuller handled career-high 21 percent target share and sat 14th at the position in fantasy points prior to suffering a season-ending injury in Week 8. The downfield playmaker has scored 11 touchdowns in 17 games during the past two seasons. Fuller is still only 25 years old and has big upside if he can stay on the field, but with DeAndre Hopkins, Keke Coutee and now Kenny Stills in the mix, he may not be worth the cost for fantasy drafters. Consider him a flex option.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":20.910213247857143,"appliedStats":{"53":27.801810005,"102":1.426094508,"72":-0.556606626,"24":2.796815452,"25":0.588393282,"26":0.0076,"42":79.25585687,"43":34.494365856,"44":0.545283388,"63":0.01188},"appliedTotal":146.371492735,"externalId":"2018","id":"102018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":4.540194459,"24":27.96815452,"25":0.098065547,"26":0.0038,"27":5.0,"28":2.0,"29":1.0,"30":1.0,"35":0.00835,"36":0.00584,"37":0.00195,"38":6.65E-5,"39":6.160122605444552,"40":1.856806939,"41":55.60362001,"42":792.5585687,"43":5.749060976,"44":0.272641694,"45":0.16391073,"46":0.107115662,"47":158.0,"48":79.0,"49":39.0,"50":31.0,"51":15.0,"52":7.0,"53":55.60362001,"54":11.0,"55":5.0,"56":1.507451149,"57":0.0466222,"58":100.8020415,"60":14.253722483490513,"61":52.61799626,"62":0.276441033,"63":0.00198,"66":0.038,"67":0.465732589,"68":0.503760986,"70":0.0175,"71":0.26081025,"72":0.278303313,"73":0.278303313,"102":0.237682418,"115":145.6088182,"210":7.0}},{"appliedAverage":7.703484175266666,"appliedStats":{"53":23.195975015,"72":-0.38080467,"42":66.10846468,"43":26.300326266,"44":0.320284042,"63":0.008017296},"appliedTotal":115.55226262899998,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"42":661.0846468,"43":4.383387711,"44":0.160142021,"45":0.230437957,"46":0.150591205,"47":132.0,"48":66.0,"49":33.0,"50":26.0,"51":13.0,"53":46.39195003,"54":9.0,"55":4.0,"56":0.920870298,"57":0.028480525,"58":77.22516716,"60":14.24998618,"61":43.88943713,"62":0.160142021,"63":0.001336216,"67":0.340004169,"68":0.340004169,"71":0.190402335,"72":0.190402335,"73":0.190402335,"210":15.0625}},{"appliedStats":{"53":1.5578553245,"72":-0.025575066,"42":4.440356754,"43":1.8968004299999999,"44":0.023215012,"63":5.382E-4},"appliedTotal":7.8931906545,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"42":44.40356754,"43":0.316133405,"44":0.011607506,"45":0.013602278,"46":0.008889089,"47":8.0,"48":4.0,"49":2.0,"50":1.0,"53":3.115710649,"56":0.069703292,"57":0.00216,"58":5.257939519,"60":14.25150553,"61":44.40356754,"62":0.011607506,"63":8.97E-5,"67":0.02283488,"68":0.02283488,"71":0.012787533,"72":0.012787533,"73":0.012787533,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":1.737859313,"72":-0.028530162,"42":5.0910989650000005,"43":1.608574554,"44":0.019508154,"63":6.000000000000001E-4},"appliedTotal":8.429110824,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"42":50.91098965,"43":0.268095759,"44":0.009754077,"45":0.013891858,"46":0.009078329,"47":10.0,"48":5.0,"49":2.0,"50":2.0,"51":1.0,"53":3.475718626,"56":0.101136416,"57":0.00312793,"58":5.996543971,"60":14.6476154,"61":50.91098965,"62":0.009754077,"63":1.0E-4,"67":0.02547336,"68":0.02547336,"71":0.014265081,"72":0.014265081,"73":0.014265081,"210":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":7.9952242063846155,"appliedStats":{"53":21.059890505,"72":-0.345736906,"42":60.57838578,"43":22.365826134,"44":0.272270174,"63":0.007278995999999999},"appliedTotal":103.937914683,"externalId":"2019","id":"122019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{"42":605.7838578,"43":3.727637689,"44":0.136135087,"45":0.183448061,"46":0.119883308,"47":121.0,"48":60.0,"49":30.0,"50":24.0,"51":12.0,"53":42.11978101,"54":8.0,"55":4.0,"56":1.037528031,"57":0.032088496,"58":71.07946512,"60":14.38240758,"61":46.59875829,"62":0.136135087,"63":0.001213166,"67":0.308693667,"68":0.308693667,"71":0.172868453,"72":0.172868453,"73":0.172868453,"210":13.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":2.5,"42":5.1000000000000005},"appliedTotal":7.6000000000000005,"externalId":"401127970","id":"01401127970","proTeamId":34,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"41":5.0,"42":51.0,"47":10.0,"48":5.0,"49":2.0,"50":2.0,"51":1.0,"53":5.0,"54":1.0,"58":7.0,"59":8.0,"60":10.2,"61":51.0,"155":1.0,"210":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":12.900000000000002,"appliedStats":{"53":16.0,"42":50.300000000000004,"43":24.0},"appliedTotal":90.30000000000001,"externalId":"2018","id":"002018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"41":32.0,"42":503.0,"43":4.0,"45":1.0,"46":1.0,"47":97.0,"48":47.0,"49":22.0,"50":16.0,"51":7.0,"52":3.0,"53":32.0,"54":4.0,"56":3.0,"58":45.0,"59":27.0,"60":15.71875,"61":31.4375,"155":11.0,"156":5.0,"174":0.6875,"210":7.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":1.5,"42":2.3000000000000003},"appliedTotal":3.8000000000000003,"externalId":"401128026","id":"01401128026","proTeamId":34,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"48":2.0,"49":1.0,"210":1.0,"53":3.0,"41":3.0,"58":6.0,"42":23.0,"59":8.0,"60":7.667,"156":1.0,"61":23.0,"47":4.0}},{"appliedAverage":7.16666666666666

However, this unit is no longer a must-start, as the \"Legion of Boom\" is no more and the team just doesn't quite make as many splash plays as they once did. Offseason departures of players like Earl Thomas and Frank Clark make the unit a bit more uneappealing, but a matchup with the Bengals shouldn't scare anyone away. Consider this unit a mid-range starting D/ST for Week 1.","2":"The Seattle defense made its fair share of big plays in Week 1, recovering fumbles and sacking the quarterback to post a decent fantasy score. However, they aren't the same defense they once were and will face a tough test against the Steelers in Week 2. You can probably find a better option on waivers.","3":"With Drew Brees under center, the outlook for the Seattle defense would have noted that Brees is efficient and careful with the ball, leaving little in terms of big play potential. However, with the Saints veteran quarterback now sidelined, the Seahawks D/ST currently offers a lot more Week 3 upside than it would have seemed just seven days ago. While they're not up to \"Legion of Boom\" standards, the Seahawks have made a few big plays on defense this season and merit consideration as a middle-of-the-pack starting D/ST. ","4":"After Week 1, it looked like the Seahawks might be an interesting pick as a D/ST. However, they've registered only one sack in the two weeks since that five-sack outburst against the Bengals, and have forced only a pair of turnovers in that time. They don't offer the big-play appeal needed to be a trustworthy defense. They also face a Cardinals offense that can put up points, even if it's in a slightly inefficient manner. Seattle's D/ST is one to consider, but you can probably find a better option."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":0.04043545878693624,"averageDraftPosition":167.21152882205513,"percentChange":25.256660372647904,"percentOwned":39.98547469755782,"percentStarted":33.66480448539031},"proTeamId":26,"rankings":{"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":10.666666666666666,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":11.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16}],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":25.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":24,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":17,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":18.833333333333332,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":17.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":6.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":5.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16}]},"seasonOutlook":"The Seattle D/ST finished 14th in fantasy points last season, which marks its first finish worse than ninth since 2010.

The unit was 10th in forced turnovers (26) and 11th in points allowed (347), though a league-high 14 fumble recoveries will be hard to repeat.

Bengals.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":4.82789921075,"appliedStats":{"96":14.389378862,"97":2.692839292,"98":0.744043882,"99":35.18915179,"132":-16.0,"101":2.125020804,"102":1.986533676,"103":6.78053352,"104":6.469885680000001,"93":0.7889462460000001,"95":22.08005362},"appliedTotal":77.246387372,"externalId":"2018","id":"102018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"93":0.131491041,"94":2.2084032000000002,"95":11.04002681,"96":7.194689431,"97":1.346419646,"98":0.372021941,"99":35.18915179,"100":70.0,"101":0.354170134,"102":0.331088946,"103":1.13008892,"104":1.07831428,"105":3.025153322,"106":11.06875297,"112":51.66549019,"113":80.82431087,"114":843.8483969,"115":258.5918381,"120":361.1479714,"122":16.0,"126":22.57174821,"127":5732.684664,"132":16.0,"137":358.2927915,"160":-361.1479714,"210":16.0}},{"appliedAverage":4.6961795605,"appliedStats":{"96":15.44539942,"97":1.4180565,"98":0.60354144,"99":35.19050414,"132":-16.0,"101":1.7214558479999997,"102":1.821085872,"103":8.3344086,"104":4.506721799999999,"123":-3.0,"93":0.737477688,"95":24.36022166},"appliedTotal":75.138872968,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"93":0.122912948,"94":2.1401884,"95":12.18011083,"96":7.72269971,"97":0.70902825,"98":0.30177072,"99":35.19050414,"100":70.38100828,"101":0.286909308,"102":0.303514312,"103":1.3890681,"104":0.7511203,"105":2.853524968,"106":11.88107648,"109":961.506205,"110":320.0,"111":192.0,"113":73.4210113,"114":826.8651154,"115":245.2274018,"116":82.0,"117":33.0,"118":24.0,"119":9.0,"120":375.9383094,"121":4.0,"122":9.0,"123":3.0,"126":23.49614434,"127":5962.010604,"132":16.0,"137":372.6256627,"160":-375.9383094,"210":16.0}},{"appliedStats":{"96":0.889629028,"97":0.090675,"98":0.041781192,"99":3.175486751,"101":0.07876124400000001,"102":0.112437804,"103":0.5685888,"104":0.2706522,"93":0.044809049999999996,"95":1.594377452},"appliedTotal":6.867198521,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"93":0.007468175,"94":0.1398735,"95":0.797188726,"96":0.444814514,"97":0.0453375,"98":0.020890596,"99":3.175486751,"100":6.350973501,"101":0.013126874,"102":0.018739634,"103":0.0947648,"104":0.0451087,"105":0.179208183,"106":0.684330021,"109":61.97719502,"110":20.0,"111":12.0,"113":4.697219906,"114":47.08657983,"115":14.91098592,"116":4.0,"117":1.0,"118":1.0,"120":22.39389535,"122":1.0,"126":22.39389535,"127":347.6843069,"131":1.0,"137":347.6843069,"160":-22.39389535,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"96":0.882037414,"97":0.087885,"98":0.040495616,"99":2.376019538,"132":-1.0,"101":0.078903282,"102":0.11287852799999999,"103":0.55109376,"104":0.26232444,"93":0.04343031,"95":1.584515066},"appliedTotal":5.0195829540000005,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"93":0.007238385,"94":0.1355697,"95":0.792257533,"96":0.441018707,"97":0.0439425,"98":0.020247808,"99":2.376019538,"100":4.752039076,"101":0.013150547,"102":0.018813088,"103":0.09184896,"104":0.04372074,"105":0.17477172,"106":0.678490318,"109":58.85373293,"110":19.0,"111":11.0,"113":4.578995629,"114":47.09564957,"115":15.18355683,"116":4.0,"117":1.0,"118":1.0,"120":20.37596321,"121":1.0,"126":20.37596321,"127":357.02175,"132":1.0,"137":357.02175,"160":-20.37596321,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"128":0.0,"129":0.0,"130":0.0,"99":4.0,"132":0.0,"133":0.0,"134":0.0,"135":0.0,"103":6.0,"136":0.0,"89":0.0,"90":0.0,"123":0.0,"91":3.0,"92":0.0,"124":0.0,"95":2.0},"appliedTotal":15.0,"externalId":"401128064","id":"01401128064","proTeamId":26,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"192":0.0,"128":0.0,"193":0.0,"129":0.0,"194":0.0,"130":0.0,"195":0.0,"131":1.0,"132":0.0,"133":0.0,"134":0.0,"135":0.0,"136":0.0,"210":1.0,"89":0.0,"90":0.0,"155":1.0,"91":1.0,"92":0.0,"94":1.0,"95":1.0,"99":4.0,"100":8.0,"103":1.0,"105":1.0,"107":23.0,"108":39.0,"109":62.0,"110":20.0,"111":12.0,"113":2.0,"114":21.0,"115":-3.0,"116":2.0,"120":10.0,"121":0.0,"122":0.0,"187":10.0,"123":0.0,"124":0.0,"188":0.0,"189":0.0,"190":1.0,"191":0.0,"127":321.0}},{"appliedAverage":6.6011189298461534,"appliedStats":{"96":14.082281678,"128":15.0,"97":1.419672692,"98":0.643031416,"99":31.27262603,"132":-10.0,"101":1.026070704,"102":1.4676594,"103":8.8787328,"104":4.2263382,"123":-2.0,"93":0.70004784,"95":19.098085328},"appliedTotal":85.814546088,"externalId":"2019","id":"122019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{"93":0.11667464,"94":2.1841785,"95":9.549042664,"96":7.041140839,"97":0.709836346,"98":0.321515708,"99":31.27262603,"100":62.54525206,"101":0.171011784,"102":0.2446099,"103":1.4797888,"104":0.7043897,"105":2.716474824,"106":10.83252437,"109":970.8054676,"110":323.0,"111":194.0,"113":72.8267730

this committee approach with Drake and Kalen Ballage will play out until kickoff on Sunday against Baltimore's stingy rush defense. Drake is likely to consume the majority of passing usage out of the backfield, an element that could prove rewarding for a team that could trail early and often as sizable home underdogs.","2":"Game script removed the rushing phase from the menu for Miami in Week 1, but it would have been nice to see Drake prove more effective and busy as a receiving threat in a blowout loss. The Patriots stymied the Steelers' backfield in Week 1, thus Drake makes for a somewhat risky flex option given Miami's position as a heavy home dog.","3":"We've yet to see Drake's big-play prowess emerge this season and this is due in part to the fact he's getting just 8.5 touches per game for the league's worst offense. Drake has shown some promise as a receiver this season, but he doesn't earn enough total touches to help offset a tough matchup with Dallas' speedy linebackers.","4":"The Dolphins tried to stick with the running game in Week 3, giving Drake 12 carries -- more than in the first two weeks combined. Sadly, he struggled to find space, gaining only 38 yards, though he did chip in with 34 more through the air. He's the lead back who plays on almost double the snaps of the next runner on the Miami depth chart, Kalen Ballage, but that doesn't guarantee fantasy appeal.

playing second fiddle to Frank Gore in the rushing department, Drake posted career-high marks in touches (173), scrimmage yards (1012) and touchdowns (nine) last season. Only 13 backs scored more fantasy points. Most of Drake's damage was done as a receiver, as he ranked 13th at the position in targets (71), 14th in receiving yards (425) and ninth in aDOT (2.1). He registered only one carry inside the opponent's 5-yard line and posted a 3.9 OTD (which wasn't far off his 3.5 OTD when he scored four touchdowns in 2017). That suggests a dip in touchdowns is coming, though his role figures to expand with Gore no longer on the roster. Drake is a serviceable RB3/flex option.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":11.156800389125001,"appliedStats":{"53":21.59717149,"101":0.20205743399999998,"72":-2.278676468,"24":84.84267981,"25":33.452800152,"26":0.370027574,"42":32.98020504,"43":7.198542186000001,"44":0.087817306,"63":0.056181702},"appliedTotal":178.50880622600002,"externalId":"2018","id":"102018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":194.2520996,"24":848.4267981,"25":5.575466692,"26":0.185013787,"27":169.0,"28":84.0,"29":42.0,"30":33.0,"31":16.0,"32":8.0,"33":38.0,"34":19.0,"35":0.396462537,"36":0.277523776,"37":1.983538877,"38":0.067690572,"39":4.367658315390481,"40":56.32709033,"41":43.19434298,"42":329.8020504,"43":1.199757031,"44":0.043908653,"45":0.049135913,"46":0.032110319,"47":65.0,"48":32.0,"49":16.0,"50":13.0,"51":6.0,"52":3.0,"53":43.19434298,"54":8.0,"55":4.0,"56":0.157879675,"57":0.004882877,"58":55.8492929,"60":7.635306562081662,"61":21.89557181,"62":0.22892244,"63":0.009363617,"66":1.949176433,"67":0.433423348,"68":2.382599781,"70":0.896621159,"71":0.242717075,"72":1.139338234,"73":1.139338234,"101":0.033676239,"114":46.31380435,"210":16.0}},{"appliedAverage":12.015736307600001,"appliedStats":{"53":31.25765032,"72":-1.997893796,"24":61.878161070000004,"25":22.922630508,"26":0.25416129,"42":52.764175800000004,"43":12.908538792000002,"44":0.200676496,"63":0.047944134},"appliedTotal":180.236044614,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":137.1855062,"24":618.7816107,"25":3.820438418,"26":0.127080645,"27":123.0,"28":61.0,"29":30.0,"30":24.0,"31":12.0,"33":27.0,"34":13.0,"35":0.271635441,"36":0.190144809,"37":1.052309548,"38":0.035911288,"39":4.510546541,"40":41.08093681,"42":527.641758,"43":2.151423132,"44":0.100338248,"45":0.06541463,"46":0.042748461,"47":105.0,"48":52.0,"49":26.0,"50":21.0,"51":10.0,"53":62.51530064,"54":12.0,"55":6.0,"56":0.494701169,"57":0.015300036,"58":83.23815008,"60":8.440201881,"61":35.03015821,"62":0.227418892,"63":0.007990689,"66":1.396754529,"67":0.636499669,"68":2.033254198,"70":0.642507083,"71":0.356439815,"72":0.998946898,"73":0.998946898,"210":15.0625}},{"appliedStats":{"53":1.5,"72":-2.0,"24":3.8000000000000003,"42":3.4000000000000004},"appliedTotal":6.700000000000001,"externalId":"401127921","id":"01401127921","proTeamId":15,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":12.0,"24":38.0,"27":7.0,"28":3.0,"29":1.0,"30":1.0,"33":2.0,"34":1.0,"39":3.167,"40":38.0,"41":3.0,"42":34.0,"47":6.0,"48":3.0,"49":1.0,"50":1.0,"53":3.0,"58":6.0,"59":38.0,"60":11.333,"61":34.0,"66":1.0,"68":1.0,"70":1.0,"72":1.0,"73":1.0,"156":1.0,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":1.578812124,"72":-0.108564692,"24":3.5034198140000004,"25":1.188005982,"26":0.01516,"42":2.5204705890000003,"43":0.500808954,"44":0.007451048,"63":0.0026160000000000003},"appliedTotal":9.208179819,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":7.683436467,"24":35.03419814,"25":0.198000997,"26":0.00758,"27":7.0,"28":3.0,"29":1.0,"30":1.0,"33":1.0,"35":0.0151,"36":0.0106,"37":0.0536,"38":0.00183,"39":4.55970428,"40":35.03419814,"42":25.20470589,"43":0.083468159,"44":0.003725524,"45":0.002608463,"46":0.001704631,"47":5.0,"48":2.0,"49":1.0,"50":1.0,"53":3.157624248,"56":0.015339253,"57":4.7441E-4,"58":4.443444321,"60":7.982173909,"61":25.20470589,"62":0.011302412,"63":4.36E-4,"66":0.0787,"67":0.032324072,"68":0.110978127,"70":0.0362,"71":0.01810148,"72":0.054282346,"73":0.054282346,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":1.693230462,"72":-0.093413746,"24":2.9560111140000003,"25":1.1491580940000001,"26":0.0141585,"42":2.7091678970000004,"43":0.511263888,"44":0.007695806,"63":0.00222726},"appliedTotal":8.949499274999999,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":6.433498255,"24":29.56011114,"25":0.191526349,"26":0.00707925,"27":5.0,"28":2.0,"29":1.0,"30":1.0,"33":1.0,"35":0.012500485,"36":0.00875034,"37":0.03811313,"38":0.001300655,"39":4.594718141,"40":29.56011114,"42":27.09167897,"43":0.085210648,"44":0.003847903,"45":0.002856874,"46":0.001866967,"47":5.0,"48":2.0,"49":1.0,"50":1.0,"53":3.386460924,"56":0.018321877,"57":5.66656E-4,"58":4.653750303,"60":7.999997512,"61":27.09167897,"62":0.010927153,"63":3.7121E-4,"66":0.061882058,"67":0.03257344,"68":0.094455499,"70":0.028465747,"71":0.018241127,"72":0.046706873,"73":0.046706873,"210":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":9.065469643230768,"appliedStats":{"53":20.33011727,"72":-1.40808252,"24":45.50905849,"25":14.379235758,"26":0.189855466,"42":32.31764103,"43":6.404916528000001,"44":0.094407216,"63":0.033956124000000004},"appliedTotal":117.85110536199998,"externalId":"2019","id":"122019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{"23":1

impression last season with a breakout performance in Weeks 1 and 2, racking up 10 catches and 147 yards plus two touchdowns. However, a knee injury would sideline him just two weeks later and erase the rest of his season. He seems to be cleared to play and ready for Week 1 but, with so much uncertainty, he's best left on benches for now.","2":"Dissly entered Week 1 as the clear starter at the TE position, but suffered an injury during Sunday's game. Before he left the contest, he did haul in a pass, but his upside in fantasy isn't that great to begin with. Even if he is good to go for Week 2, you can look elsewhere at this position.","3":"Dissly left Week 1's matchup with the Bengals with a knee injury, which was certainly a disappointment for those who took a chance on him in fantasy lineups. He returned in Week 2 and showed no ill effects, scoring a pair of touchdowns that likely failed to impact most fantasy matchups. He did see five targets against the Steelers -- a healthy amount for a tight end, outside of elite options like Travis Kelce -- so he's a name to keep on the radar. He just doesn't have a secure role that we can trust as a TE1. Consider him as a streaming option and a bench player for now.","4":"While his touchdown may have come at the end of a game on a meaningless play, it still counts for fantasy. Dissly now has three scores in three games and appears to be a trusted target near the end zone for Russell Wilson. He also received a healthy seven targets in Week 4 and now faces a premium matchup with Arizona. The Cardinals have allowed huge performances out of TEs T.J. Hockenson, Mark Andrews and Greg Olsen so far this season. Dissly has good odds to make it four in a row."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":0.17956656346749225,"averageDraftPosition":163.87831305217537,"percentChange":42.625738272574225,"percentOwned":63.977921166145215,"percentStarted":48.142581076058335},"proTeamId":26,"rankings":{"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":24,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":23,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":24,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":24,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":24,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":23,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":24,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":23,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":23.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":24.166666666666668,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6}],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":21,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":23,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":23,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":23,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":20,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":22,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":21,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":22,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":24,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":21.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":23.333333333333332,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":15.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":15.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":10.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":9.333333333333334,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6}]},"seasonOutlook":"Dissly

Michel as an RB2 option this week given how isolated he was to rushing duties last season, placing the onus on the Georgia product to net touchdowns to return value. This said, the Patriots have produced the most goal-to-go opportunities for their running backs over the past three seasons, with Michel in a good spot as the team's lead early-down force heading into Week 1.","2":"It appears averaging less than a yard per carry is a bad thing, as Michel's fantasy managers found out this past Sunday. We know Michel won't factor as a receiver very often, so he's going to need to prove dangerous as a rusher, particularly in the red zone, to deliver value. This said, the Dolphins allowed Mark Ingram to run for 49 yards on his first touch with the Ravens compiling over 200 yards on the ground in the process. If there were ever an ideal game script for Michel's skill set, this could be it.","3":"In this week's edition of causation versus correlation, we find the Patriots are now undefeated (including playoffs) in the nine games he's scored a rushing touchdown in his career. We've yet to see Michel break out as a rusher this year, but it was nice to see him accrue 18 touches in Miami. A matchup with the Jets could see Michel enjoy additional rushing work given the potential for game script to prove run heavy into the second half.","4":"Third on the backfield in snaps in Week 3 and struggling to find lanes at just 2.4 yards per carry this year, Michel's fantasy stock is on the descent.

appeared in 13 regular-season games as a rookie and handled a generous 16.1 carries per game. That helped the 2018 first-round pick to a top-15 finish in both carries (209) and rushing yards (931). Michel also racked up 12 carries inside the opponent's 5-yard line (seventh-most), which helped him accrue six rushing touchdowns. New England called run on an enormous 76 percent of Michel's snaps, which meant he was limited to 11 targets. That crushed his fantasy production, as he managed only five top-20 (two top-10) fantasy weeks. It's possible the 24-year-old plays a more versatile role in 2019, but his target share figures to increase only slightly with James White, Rex Burkhead and rookie Damien Harris in the mix. Michel is a back-end RB2 who should be upgraded in non-PPR.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":7.875169011692308,"appliedStats":{"53":12.31935027,"72":-1.14052941,"24":43.82581574,"25":21.953646396,"26":0.176721568,"42":20.16927261,"43":4.989514590000001,"44":0.055363242,"63":0.028042145999999997},"appliedTotal":102.37719715200001,"externalId":"2018","id":"102018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":101.5676322,"24":438.2581574,"25":3.658941066,"26":0.088360784,"27":87.0,"28":43.0,"29":21.0,"30":17.0,"31":8.0,"32":4.0,"33":20.0,"34":10.0,"35":0.19953896,"36":0.139677272,"37":0.635243587,"38":0.021678426,"39":4.314939197726025,"40":29.09597725,"41":24.63870054,"42":201.6927261,"43":0.831585765,"44":0.027681621,"45":0.058644309,"46":0.038324056,"47":40.0,"48":20.0,"49":10.0,"50":8.0,"51":4.0,"52":2.0,"53":24.63870054,"54":4.0,"55":2.0,"56":0.075362817,"57":0.002330809,"58":32.65141164,"60":8.186013128921287,"61":13.39038846,"62":0.116042406,"63":0.004673691,"66":0.957065441,"67":0.232168933,"68":1.189234373,"70":0.440250103,"71":0.130014602,"72":0.570264705,"73":0.570264705,"210":13.0}},{"appliedAverage":12.161119444533332,"appliedStats":{"53":5.71336544,"101":0.11890799999999999,"72":-1.526742852,"24":103.821951,"25":61.728591300000005,"26":0.31264308,"42":9.183180804000001,"43":3.0038495220000003,"44":0.022291956,"63":0.038753418},"appliedTotal":182.41679166799997,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":243.4730757,"24":1038.21951,"25":10.28809855,"26":0.15632154,"27":207.0,"28":103.0,"29":51.0,"30":41.0,"31":20.0,"33":48.0,"34":24.0,"35":0.509626779,"36":0.356738745,"37":2.972055919,"38":0.101424866,"39":4.264206654,"40":68.92743632,"42":91.83180804,"43":0.500641587,"44":0.011145978,"45":0.058290279,"46":0.038092697,"47":18.0,"48":9.0,"49":4.0,"50":3.0,"51":1.0,"53":11.42673088,"54":2.0,"55":1.0,"56":0.040074187,"57":0.001239408,"58":14.8760697,"60":8.036577478,"61":6.096717546,"62":0.167467518,"63":0.006458903,"66":1.569812088,"67":0.073674759,"68":1.643486848,"70":0.722113561,"71":0.041257865,"72":0.763371426,"73":0.763371426,"101":0.019818,"114":74.3175,"116":7.0,"117":2.0,"210":15.0625}},{"appliedStats":{"24":6.300000000000001},"appliedTotal":6.300000000000001,"externalId":"401127866","id":"01401127866","proTeamId":17,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"33":3.0,"34":1.0,"39":3.706,"40":63.0,"210":1.0,"23":17.0,"24":63.0,"27":12.0,"155":1.0,"28":6.0,"29":3.0,"30":2.0,"31":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":0.1522683865,"72":-0.102194848,"24":5.385858668000001,"25":3.160160412,"26":0.014591514,"42":0.2284130759,"43":0.065291982,"44":5.21784E-4,"63":0.00260619},"appliedTotal":8.907517164400002,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":12.85660359,"24":53.85858668,"25":0.526693402,"26":0.007295757,"27":10.0,"28":5.0,"29":2.0,"30":2.0,"31":1.0,"33":2.0,"34":1.0,"35":0.026381494,"36":0.018467046,"37":0.127,"38":0.00433,"39":4.189176893,"40":53.85858668,"42":2.284130759,"43":0.010881997,"44":2.60892E-4,"45":0.002750882,"46":0.001797701,"53":0.304536773,"56":0.001208474,"57":3.73755E-5,"58":0.396504725,"60":7.500344647,"61":2.284130759,"62":0.007556649,"63":4.34365E-4,"66":0.107967931,"67":0.002557457,"68":0.110525388,"70":0.049665248,"71":0.001432176,"72":0.051097424,"73":0.051097424,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":0.2438988625,"72":-0.160117598,"24":8.414674668000002,"25":5.55215793,"26":0.022982584,"42":0.39537155230000004,"43":0.17011773,"44":0.00143642,"63":0.00408276},"appliedTotal":14.6446049088,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":20.00781206,"24":84.14674668,"25":0.925359655,"26":0.011491292,"27":16.0,"28":8.0,"29":4.0,"30":3.0,"31":1.0,"33":4.0,"34":2.0,"35":0.043482567,"36":0.030437797,"37":0.31,"38":0.0106,"39":4.205694578,"40":84.14674668,"42":3.953715523,"43":0.028352955,"44":7.1821E-4,"45":0.003833797,"46":0.002505386,"53":0.487797725,"56":0.001893892,"57":5.8574E-5,"58":0.630775742,"60":8.105235679,"61":3.953715523,"62":0.012209502,"63":6.8046E-4,"66":0.169024156,"67":0.00412087,"68":0.173145027,"70":0.077751112,"71":0.002307687,"72":0.080058799,"73":0.080058799,"210":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":10.023655584115383,"appliedStats":{"53":1.8766812895,"72":-1.41929455,"24":75.25293442,"25":50.290244124,"26":0.224288738,"42":3.031430266,"43":1.006920576,"44":0.008102168,"63":0.036215562},"appliedTotal":130.30752259349998,"externalId":"2019","id":"122019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{"23":179.1336607,"24":752.5293442,"25":8.381707354,"26":0.112144369,"27":150.0,"28":75.0,"29":37.0,"30":30.0,"31":15.0,"33":35.0,"34":17.0,"35":0.370715106,"36":0.259500574,"37":1.925256437,"38":0.065701616,"39":4.200937676,"4

to occupy his role as Washington's top pass-catching back but must now deal with Derrius Guice along with Adrian Peterson. His upside is capped a bit more strongly, but PPR fantasy players will still roster him with some comfort as a low-end bench piece. He could fly as an Ezekiel Elliott or Melvin Gordon replacement for Week 1, and more strongly so in leagues that reward receptions. Washington may need his services frequently against the talented Eagles, after all.","2":"Thompson touched the rock 10 times in Week 1 to total 78 scrimmage yards during a disappointing loss to Philadelphia. Expect him to be busy again versus Dallas, especially now that Derrius Guice (knee) will miss at least one week. Adrian Peterson will be activated, but Thompson coexisted with the veteran on many occasions last year -- and Thompson remains the better bet in passing-down work. He's a decent flex in most fantasy formats against the Cowboys, who should force Washington to pass often.","3":"As expected, Thompson did most of his damage versus Dallas through the air in Week 2. With Derrius Guice (knee) out through at least Washington's Week 10 bye, Thompson will continue splitting work in the backfield with Adrian Peterson. Against the sturdy Bears defense in Week 3, Thompson will probably see plenty of work on screen passes, which cements his flex value -- more strongly so in PPR games.","4":"Thompson was used heavily in Week 3 versus the Bears, as he's deployed frequently when the team is trailing and needs to pass. Thompson has had four-plus catches and at least 48 receiving yards in each of his first three games.

has emerged as one of the league's better receiving backs in recent years, but injuries have derailed his chances for a full-on breakout. The 28-year-old back has missed exactly six games each of the past two seasons. Thompson's best season came in 2017, when he put up 804 scrimmage yards and six touchdowns on 103 touches in 10 games. Thompson has never cleared 68 carries in a season (though he has benefited from light boxes), but he's averaging an impressive 4.96 YPC in his career. Interestingly, he paced the position in YPR (13.1) and YPT (9.8) in 2017 but finished sixth-worst (6.4) and fifth-worst (4.9), respectively, last season. Thompson will continue to be limited to passing situations behind Adrian Peterson and Derrius Guice, which severely limits his fantasy upside.

competition for targets with several capable peers in the passing game, Hopkins remains Houston's most prolific playmaker and should feast in a prime-time matchup with a Saints team that surrendered the most yards to receivers last season. It helps Hopkins' case that this contest claims the highest point total of the opening slate.","2":"Hopkins delivered his ninth career multi-score showing in Week 1, leaving him one shy of tying Andre Johnson for most in Texans history. Just as impressively, Hopkins tallied a team-high 13 targets and should again dominate that market against Jacksonville's Jalen Ramsey in Week 2. Even with that tough matchup, you can start Hopkins with confidence.","3":"Jalen Ramsey was effective in shadowing Hopkins in Week 2, limiting him to just 40 receiving yards, a mark he dipped below just once all of last season. With a potential shootout on deck with the Chargers in Los Angeles, a defense that was just gashed by T.Y. Hilton and Kenny Golladay in consecutive weeks, Hopkins is due for a bounce-back performance for the Texans in Week 3.","4":"With nearly a third of the Texans' total targets through three games and the same share of yardage production, Hopkins once again claims a uniquely high weekly floor.

has been the No. 2 scoring fantasy wide receiver during each of the past two seasons and has finished in the top 4 three of the past four seasons. Hopkins has been a workhorse, ranking no lower than sixth in targets, receptions, yardage, touchdowns and end zone targets during each of the past two seasons. He has topped the position in OTD both seasons. Finally attached to a quality quarterback for a full season, Hopkins caught a career-high 70 percent of his targets in 2018. Hopkins has managed a massive 35 percent target share over the past two seasons. That could drop some with Kenny Stills, Will Fuller V and Keke Coutee in the mix, but Hopkins will still rank at or near the top of the position in the category. The sure-handed 27-year-old remains an elite fantasy asset.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":14.633390478625001,"appliedStats":{"53":47.15,"72":-1.141634694,"42":132.03,"43":55.199999999999996,"44":0.871846862,"63":0.02403549},"appliedTotal":234.13424765800002,"externalId":"2018","id":"102018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"41":94.3,"42":1320.3,"43":9.2,"44":0.435923431,"45":0.170513101,"46":0.111430311,"47":264.0,"48":132.0,"49":66.0,"50":52.0,"51":26.0,"52":13.0,"53":94.3,"54":18.0,"55":9.0,"56":5.100481149,"57":0.15774684,"58":166.3,"60":14.001060445387063,"61":82.52007114,"62":0.435923431,"63":0.004005915,"67":1.01931669,"68":1.0,"71":0.570817347,"72":0.570817347,"73":0.570817347,"210":16.0}},{"appliedAverage":15.094765338375,"appliedStats":{"53":50.64495375,"72":-1.374229468,"42":134.5479001,"43":56.974851732000005,"44":0.693836862,"63":0.028932437999999998},"appliedTotal":241.516245414,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"42":1345.479001,"43":9.495808622,"44":0.346918431,"45":0.246681721,"46":0.161206505,"47":269.0,"48":134.0,"49":67.0,"50":53.0,"51":26.0,"53":101.2899075,"54":20.0,"55":10.0,"56":5.27258973,"57":0.163069785,"58":154.4503343,"60":13.28344585,"61":84.09243755,"62":0.346918431,"63":0.004822073,"67":1.226990596,"68":1.226990596,"71":0.687114734,"72":0.687114734,"73":0.687114734,"210":16.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":3.024038485,"72":-0.067994182,"42":7.726553085000001,"43":3.9412818540000005,"44":0.048237496,"63":0.001434},"appliedTotal":14.673550738000001,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"42":77.26553085,"43":0.656880309,"44":0.024118748,"45":0.011261561,"46":0.00735943,"47":15.0,"48":7.0,"49":3.0,"50":3.0,"51":1.0,"53":6.04807697,"54":1.0,"56":0.280004012,"57":0.00866,"58":9.588007358,"60":12.77522281,"61":77.26553085,"62":0.024118748,"63":2.39E-4,"67":0.060709092,"68":0.060709092,"71":0.033997091,"72":0.033997091,"73":0.033997091,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":3.050260582,"72":-0.068837892,"42":7.997248810000001,"43":3.0357943379999996,"44":0.03681691,"63":0.001452},"appliedTotal":14.052734748,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"42":79.9724881,"43":0.505965723,"44":0.018408455,"45":0.010940181,"46":0.007149408,"47":15.0,"48":7.0,"49":3.0,"50":3.0,"51":1.0,"53":6.100521164,"54":1.0,"56":0.300308719,"57":0.009287899,"58":9.994239951,"60":13.10912395,"61":79.9724881,"62":0.018408455,"63":2.42E-4,"67":0.061462403,"68":0.061462403,"71":0.034418946,"72":0.034418946,"73":0.034418946,"210":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":14.805890171000003,"appliedStats":{"53":40.880509495,"72":-0.919180376,"42":105.45714270000002,"43":46.47300963,"44":0.565738746,"63":0.019352028},"appliedTotal":192.47657222300003,"externalId":"2019","id":"122019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{"42":1054.571427,"43":7.745501605,"44":0.282869373,"45":0.15233222,"46":0.099549106,"47":210.0,"48":105.0,"49":52.0,"50":42.0,"51":21.0,"53":81.76101899,"54":16.0,"55":8.0,"56":4.011835207,"57":0.124077378,"58":129.6154952,"60":12.89821776,"61":81.12087899,"62":0.282869373,"63":0.003225338,"67":0.820696765,"68":0.820696765,"71":0.459590188,"72":0.459590188,"73":0.459590188,"210":13.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":3.0,"42":6.7},"appliedTotal":9.7,"externalId":"401127970","id":"01401127970","proTeamId":34,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"41":6.0,"42":67.0,"47":13.0,"48":6.0,"49":3.0,"50":2.0,"51":1.0,"53":6.0,"54":1.0,"58":7.0,"59":36.0,"60":11.167,"61":67.0,"155":1.0,"210":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":17.25,"appliedStats":{"53":57.5,"72":-4.0,"24":-0.7000000000000001,"42":157.20000000000002,"43":66.0},"appliedTotal":276.0,"externalId":"2018","id":"002018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":1.0,"2":1.0,"23":1.0,"24":-7.0,"39":-7.0,"40":-0.4375,"41":115.0,"42":1572.0,"43":11.0,"45":2.0,"47":309.0,"48":151.0,"49":71.0,"50":56.0,"51":25.0,"52":7.0,"53":115.0,"54":18.0,"55":4.0,"56":7.0,"58":163.0,"59":88.0,"60":13.669565217391304,"61":98.25,"67":2.0,"68":2.0,"71":2.0,"72":2.0,"73":2.0,"108":2.0,"109":2.0,"113":1.0,"155":11.0,"156":5.0,"174":0.6875,"210":16.0}},{"appliedStats":{"20":-2.0,"53":2.5,"42":4.1000000000000005},"appliedTotal":4.6000000000000005,"externalId":"401128026","id":"01401128026","proTeamId":34,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"0":1.0,"2":1.0,"41":5.0,"73":1.0,"42":41.0,"47":8.0,"48":4.0,"49":2.0,"210":1.0,"50":1.0,"20":1.0,"53":5.0,"54":1.0,"58":8.0,"59":8.0,"60":8.2,"156":1.0,"61":41.0}},{"appliedAverage":14.433333333333332,"appliedStats":{"53":9.5,"42":21.8,"43":12.0},"appliedTotal":43.3,"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","p

prospects is the potential for the Bengals to trail big as sizable road dogs in this game—potentially affording Gio Bernard additional exposure as a receiver. Working in Mixon's favor? Seattle allowed almost three yards before contact per rush, among the most generous in the league. Unless Seattle has solved its rush defense issues, Mixon is set up for a strong opener.","2":"The collective sigh you heard on Monday? It came from Mixon's fantasy managers after an MRI confirmed the ankle injury that knocked him out of Week 1 isn't considered serious. If he's available for Week 2 against the 49ers, Mixon is in a strong spot to produce given San Francisco just yielded a strong day from scrimmage to the Bucs' Ronald Jones.","3":"Mixon's managers are vexed. He's averaging 11 touches and 22 scrimmage yards after two good matchups. The hope is Mixon can handle a heavy workload another week removed from a tweaking his knee in the opener.

appeared in 14 games last season and handled a generous 16.9 carries and 3.9 targets per game. His rushing efficiency took a giant step forward from that of his rookie season, as the 2017 second-round pick boosted his yards per carry from 3.5 to 4.9 and his YAC from 1.7 to 1.9. Mixon quietly ended up fourth at the position in rushing yards (1,168), sixth in both touches (280) and scrimmage yards (1,464), and 10th in fantasy points (243). The Bengals' offensive line remains a problem area, but 22-year-old Mixon is a workhorse back positioned well for another step forward in his third season. Consider him a fringe

interesting running backs in the league, as he posts incredible numbers on a per-carry basis, but doesn't seem to get a big boost in volume as a result. Still, he managed to score nine times one year ago and is healthy and ready to go as the Packers' starter in 2019. However, he faces a very tough test against a Bears team that allowed the fewest fantasy points-per-game last season, so he's more of an RB2/RB3 than a borderline RB1. ","2":"Jones is definitely the lead back for the Packers, but in Week 1 it hardly mattered given how poor the Packers offense performed against the stalwart Bears defense. It's hard to expect much more in Week 2 against the Vikings, a team that ranked among the 10 toughest matchups for running backs a season ago. Minnesota also held Devonta Freeman to only 31 total yards in Week 1. As such, Jones is at the fringe of the RB2 discussion and is probably more safely considered a flex pick. ","3":"Jones is on the heavy end of a timeshare with Jamaal Williams, but it's fairly close in terms of snaps played. When it comes to carries, however, Jones has a massive lead, and that's led to him outgaining Williams on the ground by almost 130 yards over two weeks. Since the Broncos are very tough against the pass, Green Bay may look to establish the run in Week 3. That worked fairly well for the Raiders in Week 1, as Josh Jacobs picked up 85 yards and two scores, and again in Week 2 when David Mongtomgery scored and racked up 62 yards. Jones should see a healthy number of carries and can be expected to do fairly well despite going up against a talented defense. Lock him in as a high-end RB2.","4":"The Packers backfield is a curious one from a fantasy perspective, as Jones played on fewer snaps than Jamaal Williams in Week 3 after out-snapping him in both Weeks 1 and 2. Yet, he still found the end zone twice and saw 10 carries in his limited playing time -- albeit with a low 1.9 YPC. Still, this backfield is an even split and Jones offers upside as a regular player in a backfield with one of the league's best quarterbacks. All that said, Week 4 brings a very tough test against an Eagles defense which has allowed the fifth-fewest RB fantasy points per game. Downgrade Jones to a borderline RB2 and more of a RB3/flex play."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":20.239938080495357,"averageDraftPosition":49.89249104092008,"percentChange":0.1646957836518652,"percentOwned":97.9835930647164,"percentStarted":81.8443633733183},"proTeamId":9,"rankings":{"0":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"1":[],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":23,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":22,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":21,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":20,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":20,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":22,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":19.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":21.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":17,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":10.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":12.166666666666666,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":27,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":27,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":27,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":27,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23}]},"seasonOutlook":"For the second consecutive season, Jones was one of the league's more efficient running backs in 2018, but a limited role and missed games precluded the 2017 fifth-round pick from consistent fantasy production. Jones has missed four games in each of the past two seasons but has averaged a healthy 5.5 YPC during both campaigns. Despite playing only 51 percent of the snaps, Jones posted a trio of top-10 fantasy weeks and ranked 13th at the position in fantasy points during the 11 weeks in which he wasn't out or injured last season. With a new coaching staff in place, Jones is the favorite to lead a committee with Jamaal Williams this season. Jones will be positioned for around 200 carries and a modest receiving role, which should allow for solid RB2 numbers.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":7.166337965666667,"appliedStats":{"53":5.35094471,"72":-0.89754644,"24":51.58269467,"25":18.213029112,"26":0.23840905,"42":8.630292670000001,"43":2.821808166,"44":0.03383269,"63":0.02259096},"appliedTotal":85.996055588,"externalId":"2018","id":"102018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":116.3890538,"24":515.8269467,"25":3.035504852,"26":0.119204525,"27":103.0,"28":51.0,"29":25.0,"30":20.0,"31":10.0,"32":5.0,"33":23.0,"34":11.0,"35":0.229946172,"36":0.16096232,"37":0.836008398,"38":0.028529759,"39":4.43191975412382,"40":39.3011007,"41":10.70188942,"42":86.3029267,"43":0.470301361,"44":0.016916345,"45":0.048520411,"46":0.031708088,"47":17.0,"48":8.0,"49":4.0,"50":3.0,"51":1.0,"53":10.70188942,"54":2.0,"55":1.0,"56":0.036942803,"57":0.001142561,"58":14.15664917,"60":8.064270084749202,"61":6.575461082,"62":0.136120869,"63":0.00376516,"66":0.877381415,"67":0.080674587,"68":0.958056002,"70":0.403595451,"71":0.045177769,"72":0.44877322,"73":0.44877322,"210":12.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":3.0,"24":2.1,"25":6.0,"42":3.7},"appliedTotal":14.8,"externalId":"401127863","id":"01401127863","proTeamId":9,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"210":1.0,"23":13.0,"24":21.0,"25":1.0,"27":4.0,"28":2.0,"156":1.0,"29":1.0,"158":6.0,"33":2.0,"34":1.0,"39":1.615,"40":21.0,"41":6.0,"42":37.0,"47":7.0,"48":3.0,"49":1.0,"50":1.0,"179":1.0,"53":6.0,"54":1.0,"58":7.0,"59":49.0,"60":6.167,"61":37.0}},{"appliedAverage":15.136403821714286,"appliedStats":{"53":18.46783545,"72":-1.751057744,"24":102.75906800000001,"25":54.073389672000005,"26":0.69347557,"42":27.89893797,"43":9.57395592,"44":0.150526616,"63":0.04352205},"appliedTotal":211.909653504,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":220.337866,"24":1027.59068,"25":9.012231612,"26":0.346737785,"27":205.0,"28":102.0,"29":51.0,"30":41.0,"31":20.0,"33":44.0,"34":22.0,"35":0.455930821,"36":0.319151575,"37":2.922735001,"38":0.099741732,"39":4.663704421,"40":72.74978265,"42":278.9893797,"43":1.59565932,"44":0.075263308,"45":0.049130798,"46":0.032106977,"47":55.0,"48":27.0,"49":13.0,"50":11.0,"51":5.0,"53":36.9356709,"54":7.0,"55":3.0,"56":0.116413899,"57":0.00360043,"58":47.3517553,"60":7.553386005,"61":19.75146051,"62":0.422001093,"63":0.007253675,"66":1.580736817,"67":0.264982029,"68":1.845718846,"70":0.727138936,"71":0.148389936,"72":0.875528872,"73":0.875528872,"210":14.125}},{"appliedStats":{"53":1.1679403285,"72":-0.15566789,"24":5.8038303010000005,"25":4.0231932,"26":0.046,"42":1.726196112,"43":0.579887088,"44":0.009684274,"63":0.0038640000000000002},"appliedTotal":13.2049274135,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":13.19314809,"24":58.03830301,"25":0.6705322,"26":0.023,"27":11.0,"28":5.0,"29":2.0,"30":2.0,"31":1.0,"33":2.0,"34":1.0,"35":0.0271,"36":0.019,"37":0.147,"38":0.00503,"39":4.399124652,"40":58.03830301,"42":17.26196112,"43":0.096647848,"44":0.004842137,"45":0.002745052,"46":0.001793891,"47":3.0,"48":1.0,"53":2.335880657,"56":0.007113307,"57":2.19999E-4,"58":2.998321535,"60":7.389915692,"61":17.26196112,"62":0.027846569,"63":6.44E-4,"66":0.139,"67":0.024645825,"68":0.163846441,"70":0.064,"71":0.013801662,"72":0.077833945,"73":0.077833945,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":1.189265468,"72":-0.166349814,"24":8.439177642999999,"25":3.816419442,"26":0.0476,"42":1.752074807,"43":0.671110038,"44":0.01070635,"63":0.004158},"appliedTotal":15.764161933999997,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":17.97162882,"24":84.39177643,"25":0.636069907,"26":0.0238,"27":16.0,"28":8.0,"29":4.0,"30":3.0,"31":1.0,"33":3.0,"34":1.0,"35":0.0384,"36":0.0269,"37":0.312,"38":0.0106,"39":4.695833488,"40":84.39177643,"42":17.52074807,"43":0.111851673,"44":0.005353175,"45":0.002747795,"46":0.001795684,"47":3.0,"48":1.0,"53":2.378530936,"56":0.007288785,"57":2.25426E-4,"58":3.04241122,"60":7.366205669,"61":17.52074807,"62":0.02916015,"63":6.93E-4,"66":0.156,"67":0.020610022,"68":0.176334576,"70":0.0716,"71":0.011541612,"72":0.083174907,"73":0.083174907,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":0.5,"24":1.9000000000000001,"25":12.0,"42":0.4},"appliedTotal":14.8,"externalId":"401127925","id":"01401127925","proTeamId":9,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":10.0,"24":19.0,"25":2.0,"27":3.0,"28":1.0,"33":2.0,"34":1.0,"39":1.9,"40":19.0,"41":1.0,"42":4.0,"53":1.0,"58":1.0,"59":3.0,"60":4.0,"61":4.0,"155":1.0,"158":12.0,"179":2.0,"210":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":12.846499026538465,"appliedStats":{"53":15.299093575,"72":-1.9831252,"24":76.53981063,"25":46.844321532,"26":0.55327428,"42":22.54382498,"43":7.0418098019999995,"44":0.116304296,"63":0.0491734

historic season is never easy, but if anyone is up to the challenge, it's Mahomes. The Chiefs take their offensive circus to a Jacksonville to face a strong defense due for some positive regression this season. Even with a formidable opponent in place, Mahomes remains a surefire QB1 given the Madden-like numbers that surfaced last season.","2":"Already up to five career games with at least 350 passing yards and three scores (the most in the league since 2018), Mahomes continues to destroy defenses into his second year as a starter. Since the start of last season, the Raiders have allowed the most points per drive and the most yards per play to opponents, with Mahomes once again poised with the top projection of the slate.","3":"With four passing scores in the second quarter against Oakland, Mahomes set the franchise record for touchdowns in a quarter. The Ravens have been solid on defense but did allow Kyler Murray to enjoy a strong passing performance in Week 3, while Mahomes is clearly already matchup-proof and the rare must-start signal-caller for fantasy purposes.","4":"Through 20 career games, Mahomes has the most passing scores, yards, 300-yard games, and the highest completion percentage in league history and just became the first player in the last 40 seasons with 250 passing yards and two passing scores in the first half of three straight games. The Lions have produced a strong pressure on opposing passers this season, but Mahomes is probably matchup-proof at this point."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":31.777089783281735,"averageDraftPosition":10.448816272090697,"percentChange":0.013060866306844332,"percentOwned":99.8990304351117,"percentStarted":98.76665747895991},"proTeamId":12,"rankings":{"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":2.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":2.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":1.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":1.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":1.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":1.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":1.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":1.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}]},"seasonOutlook":"If you took a shot on Mahomes late in your 2018 fantasy draft, congratulations, you probably won your league. Mahomes exploded onto the fantasy scene with 12 top-10 fantasy weeks en route to finishing as the top-scoring QB by 62 points over second-place Matt Ryan. Mahomes paced the league in passing touchdowns (50) and was second in passing yards (5,097), while adding 272 yards and two scores rushing. Entering his third season, Mahomes looks like the next great NFL quarterback -- and should be the top QB off the board in all drafts -- but history suggests we should expect a substantial statistical dip. Daunte Culpepper was the last to repeat as the No. 1 fantasy quarterback, and that was way back in 2003-04.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":17.002164558624997,"appliedStats":{"19":1.730205198,"4":89.69170056,"20":-29.89353744,"8":164.0,"72":-8.177476724,"24":34.396518809999996,"25":19.934887074,"26":0.150620554,"63":0.201714906},"appliedTotal":272.03463293799996,"externalId":"2018","id":"102018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":549.1592405,"1":343.7627977,"2":205.3964428,"3":4122.981681,"4":22.42292514,"5":824.0,"6":412.0,"7":206.0,"8":164.0,"9":82.0,"10":41.0,"11":68.0,"12":34.0,"13":41.0,"14":20.0,"15":3.566158949,"16":2.330484873,"17":4.045087853,"18":0.546385306,"19":0.865102599,"20":14.94676872,"21":0.625980175,"22":258.8999486,"23":66.54481135,"24":343.9651881,"25":3.322481179,"26":0.075310277,"27":68.0,"28":34.0,"29":17.0,"30":13.0,"31":6.0,"32":3.0,"33":13.0,"34":6.0,"35":0.126731865,"36":0.088712306,"37":0.322176442,"38":0.010994646,"39":5.168925737738979,"40":21.59906989,"62":0.940412875,"63":0.033619151,"64":37.9588929,"65":7.683618885,"66":0.870872385,"68":8.55449127,"69":3.688137065,"70":0.400601297,"72":4.088738362,"73":19.03550708,"210":16.0}},{"appliedStats":{"4":12.0,"8":14.0,"24":0.9},"appliedTotal":26.9,"externalId":"401127953","id":"01401127953","proTeamId":12,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"0":37.0,"1":27.0,"2":10.0,"3":374.0,"4":3.0,"5":74.0,"6":37.0,"7":18.0,"8":14.0,"9":7.0,"10":3.0,"11":5.0,"12":2.0,"13":2.0,"14":1.0,"15":1.0,"16":1.0,"17":1.0,"21":72.973,"22":374.0,"23":4.0,"24":9.0,"27":1.0,"39":2.25,"40":9.0,"64":1.0,"66":1.0,"68":1.0,"155":1.0,"176":2.0,"210":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":22.813418832933333,"appliedStats":{"19":2.229277528,"4":141.54772504,"20":-23.7229125,"8":189.0,"72":-8.620884522,"24":22.37974075,"25":19.012930284,"26":0.162963056,"63":0.212442858},"appliedTotal":342.201282494,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":577.5313579,"1":374.5359335,"2":202.9954245,"3":4730.124585,"4":35.38693126,"5":946.0,"6":473.0,"7":236.0,"8":189.0,"9":94.0,"10":47.0,"11":74.0,"12":37.0,"15":4.607551845,"16":3.011035131,"17":6.934706235,"18":0.936696983,"19":1.114638764,"20":11.86145625,"21":0.648511857,"22":301.2818207,"23":51.72630533,"24":223.7974075,"25":3.168821714,"26":0.081481528,"27":44.0,"28":22.0,"29":11.0,"30":8.0,"31":4.0,"33":10.0,"34":5.0,"35":0.097698382,"36":0.068388867,"37":0.135972092,"38":0.00464,"39":4.326568581,"40":14.25461194,"62":1.196120292,"63":0.035407143,"64":32.04109729,"65":8.3047384,"66":0.704712673,"68":9.009451073,"69":3.986274432,"70":0.324167829,"72":4.310442261,"73":16.17189852,"210":15.7}},{"appliedStats":{"19":0.154734598,"4":10.650010888,"20":-1.19738344,"8":13.0,"72":-0.581671958,"24":1.134977526,"25":1.053344376,"26":0.010633156,"63":0.014340000000000002},"appliedTotal":24.238985146,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"0":38.92787241,"1":25.87225916,"2":13.05561324,"3":325.8844599,"4":2.662502722,"5":65.0,"6":32.0,"7":16.0,"8":13.0,"9":6.0,"10":3.0,"11":5.0,"12":2.0,"15":0.345646363,"16":0.225879898,"17":0.635336974,"18":0.085817367,"19":0.077367299,"20":0.59869172,"21":0.664620427,"22":325.8844599,"23":2.723610591,"24":11.34977526,"25":0.175557396,"26":0.005316578,"27":2.0,"28":1.0,"35":0.005120669,"36":0.003584469,"37":0.005567006,"38":1.9E-4,"39":4.167179882,"40":11.34977526,"62":0.082683877,"63":0.00239,"64":1.605871818,"65":0.569251925,"66":0.03825012,"68":0.607502045,"69":0.273240924,"70":0.017595055,"72":0.290835979,"73":0.889527699,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"19":0.147243242,"4":9.567504924,"20":-1.261318424,"8":12.0,"72":-0.517575574,"24":1.1873689680000001,"25":1.220044128,"26":0.010738738,"63":0.012719999999999999},"appliedTotal":22.366726002000004,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"0":36.78267265,"1":24.20649949,"2":12.57617315,"3":307.0480072,"4":2.391876231,"5":61.0,"6":30.0,"7":15.0,"8":12.0,"9":6.0,"10":3.0,"11":4.0,"12":2.0,"15":0.308933838,"16":0.201888263,"17":0.500948129,"18":0.067664957,"19":0.073621621,"20":0.630659212,"21":0.658095178,"22":307.0480072,"23":2.839100785,"24":11.87368968,"25":0.203340688,"26":0.005369369,"27":2.0,"28":1.0,"35":0.005343365,"36":0.003740355,"37":0.006096876,"38":2.08E-4,"39":4.182200836,"40":11.87368968,"62":0.07899099,"63":0.00212,"64":1.582625817,"65":0.503438199,"66":0.037255328,"68":0.540693527,"69":0.241650336,"70":0.017137451,"72":0.258787787,"73":0.889446999,"210":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":25.3254422895,"appliedStats":{"19":1.95566586,"4":132.26032512,"20":-15.17557569,"8":165.0,"72":-7.387530502,"24":14.884038490000002,"25":12.069391367999998,"26":0.117041172,"63":0.18195165600000002},"appliedTotal":303.905307474,"externalId":"2019","id":"122019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seaso

Godwin nevertheless remains a breakout candidate for 2019. Against the Panthers in Week 2, count him as a high-end fantasy WR3. ","3":"Godwin seems to be the big winner in the Buccaneers' new offense, scoring twice and averaging 7.5 targets and 87 receiving yards over the first two games. Against the Giants' wobbly defense, which has allowed a league-high 550 WR receiving yards, he should once again take the spotlight. Rank him as a strong WR2 for fantasy purposes in Week 3.","4":"Godwin commanded just four targets in Week 3 as Jameis Winston and Mike Evans connected for three scores. Godwin hadn't seen fewer than six targets in the two previous games and could be leaned upon a bit more against the Rams, who've allowed the sixth-fewest fantasy WR points-per-game. Godwin is a strong fantasy WR3, with a WR2 ceiling during what could be a comeback effort in Week 4."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":11.078947368421053,"averageDraftPosition":74.29038173028839,"percentChange":-0.9023447805148948,"percentOwned":94.88526975917614,"percentStarted":52.54586646465107},"proTeamId":27,"rankings":{"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":23,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":22,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":24,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":21.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":18.166666666666668,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"2":[],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":11.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":11.166666666666666,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":40,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":20,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":40,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":21,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":40,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":20,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":16.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":18.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":44,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":40,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23}]},"seasonOutlook":"Godwin was limited to 57 percent of the Buccaneers' pass plays last season but still managed a 59/842/7 line and 27th-place finish in fantasy points. The 2017 third-round pick ranked 52nd at the position in routes, but was 25th in receiving yards and 13th in touchdowns thanks to a solid 9.0 YPT and 14 end zone targets (sixth most). Godwin has three drops on 150 career targets and has ranked top 5 in first down rate each of his two NFL seasons. New coach Bruce Arians, whose wide receivers ranked fifth in fantasy points during his five seasons as Arizona's head coach, says he believes Godwin could push for 100 catches in 2019.

three-down usage at times in the preseason, but Nyheim Hines still looms as the backfield's top receiving threat, casting doubt over Mack's ascension as an every-down force. Using last season's as precedent, expect Mack to lead the team in rushes, including around the goal line. The Chargers allowed the 11th-fewest yards to tailbacks last season, keeping Mack in the RB2 tier.","2":"Mack rumbled for 119 yards in the third quarter, the most by a Colts player in a single quarter since the franchise moved to Indianapolis in 1984. The Colts' Week 2 opponent, the Titans, held down Nick Chubb in Week 1, but Cleveland's back still had a respectable fantasy showing. With a heavy early-down workload, Mack is a strong RB2 candidate for Week 2.","3":"Leading the league in carries, Mack is one of two backs averaging at least 20 rushes through two games. His 45 total rushes this season are the most by an Indianapolis running back since Edgerrin James registered 50 in his team's first two games in 2005. The Falcons have allowed a generous 107 yards rushing per game this season, and Mack is poised for another strong day on the ground.","4":"One of the rare feature backs left in the league, Mack is averaging a robust 21.7 touches per game and has consumed a strong share of the Colts' receiving workload that evaded his profile last season.

you blinked, you may have missed it, but Mack scored 10 touchdowns in 12 games during the 2018 season. The 2017 fourth-round pick seemingly struggled as a rookie, averaging 3.85 YPC, but his 2.25 YAC suggested a second-year leap. That was indeed the case, as Mack's YPC jumped to 4.66 and allowed him 908 yards on 195 carries. Mack appears to be an effective NFL rusher, but he has yet to make much of an impact as a receiver. He was held to 26 targets and posted an ugly 65 percent catch rate (second-worst among backs) last season. Andrew Luck's retirement and limited receiving work caps his fantasy ceiling, but Mack will get enough volume to allow fringe RB2 numbers.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":10.216943533916668,"appliedStats":{"53":14.042836565,"101":0.23781599999999997,"72":-1.449780054,"24":55.812306420000006,"25":23.977774998,"26":0.257645998,"42":23.274778800000004,"43":6.349584018,"44":0.064510922,"63":0.03584874},"appliedTotal":122.60332240700002,"externalId":"2018","id":"102018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":139.0276942,"24":558.1230642,"25":3.996295833,"26":0.128822999,"27":111.0,"28":55.0,"29":27.0,"30":22.0,"31":11.0,"32":5.0,"33":27.0,"34":13.0,"35":0.276987969,"36":0.193891578,"37":0.916812125,"38":0.03128728,"39":4.014474003985891,"40":39.68875123,"41":28.08567313,"42":232.747788,"43":1.058264003,"44":0.032255461,"45":0.055993745,"46":0.036591912,"47":46.0,"48":23.0,"49":11.0,"50":9.0,"51":4.0,"52":2.0,"53":28.08567313,"54":5.0,"55":2.0,"56":0.091345996,"57":0.002825134,"58":37.4551913,"60":8.287064615566862,"61":16.55095382,"62":0.16107846,"63":0.00597479,"66":1.264795219,"67":0.255507547,"68":1.520302766,"70":0.581805801,"71":0.143084226,"72":0.724890027,"73":0.724890027,"101":0.039636,"114":148.635,"210":12.0}},{"appliedAverage":11.839880699400002,"appliedStats":{"53":13.792140895,"72":-2.148709008,"24":103.35450850000001,"25":34.638333456,"26":0.484519618,"42":21.26964504,"43":6.059613222,"44":0.09433413,"63":0.053824637999999994},"appliedTotal":177.59821049100003,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":231.1017551,"24":1033.545085,"25":5.773055576,"26":0.242259809,"27":206.0,"28":103.0,"29":51.0,"30":41.0,"31":20.0,"33":46.0,"34":23.0,"35":0.480781143,"36":0.3365468,"37":2.955628894,"38":0.100864275,"39":4.472251129,"40":68.61710109,"42":212.6964504,"43":1.009935537,"44":0.047167065,"45":0.042689348,"46":0.027897489,"47":42.0,"48":21.0,"49":10.0,"50":8.0,"51":4.0,"53":27.58428179,"54":5.0,"55":2.0,"56":0.080009351,"57":0.00247,"58":37.52340074,"60":7.710784424,"61":14.12092617,"62":0.289426874,"63":0.008970773,"66":2.039236501,"67":0.24340306,"68":2.282639561,"70":0.93804879,"71":0.136305713,"72":1.074354504,"73":1.074354504,"210":15.0625}},{"appliedStats":{"53":0.6845233585,"72":-0.142122888,"24":9.413259348,"25":2.67142725,"26":0.0426,"42":1.08045978,"43":0.52623066,"44":0.007646208,"63":0.003594},"appliedTotal":14.2876177165,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":20.97080839,"24":94.13259348,"25":0.445237875,"26":0.0213,"27":18.0,"28":9.0,"29":4.0,"30":3.0,"31":1.0,"33":4.0,"34":2.0,"35":0.0459,"36":0.0321,"37":0.388,"38":0.0132,"39":4.488744151,"40":94.13259348,"42":10.8045978,"43":0.08770511,"44":0.003823104,"45":0.002854898,"46":0.001865676,"47":2.0,"48":1.0,"53":1.369046717,"56":0.004054069,"57":1.25384E-4,"58":1.856341551,"60":7.892059245,"61":10.8045978,"62":0.025100149,"63":5.99E-4,"66":0.143,"67":0.009342573,"68":0.152450405,"70":0.0658,"71":0.005231841,"72":0.071061444,"73":0.071061444,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":0.7240356555,"72":-0.169773146,"24":8.651526500000001,"25":2.468400924,"26":0.035575974,"42":1.086354668,"43":0.43626904199999994,"44":0.00666754,"63":0.0042860220000000004},"appliedTotal":13.243343179500004,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":19.20251527,"24":86.515265,"25":0.411400154,"26":0.017787987,"27":17.0,"28":8.0,"29":4.0,"30":3.0,"31":1.0,"33":3.0,"34":1.0,"35":0.041470135,"36":0.029029094,"37":0.328,"38":0.0112,"39":4.50541316,"40":86.515265,"42":10.86354668,"43":0.072711507,"44":0.00333377,"45":0.002367727,"46":0.001547309,"47":2.0,"48":1.0,"53":1.448071311,"56":0.004073749,"57":1.25992E-4,"58":1.975844041,"60":7.5020799,"61":10.86354668,"62":0.021121756,"63":7.14337E-4,"66":0.169019359,"67":0.012745835,"68":0.181765194,"70":0.077748905,"71":0.007137667,"72":0.084886573,"73":0.084886573,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"24":3.9000000000000004},"appliedTotal":3.9000000000000004,"externalId":"401128030","id":"01401128030","proTeamId":11,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"33":2.0,"210":1.0,"34":1.0,"23":11.0,"39":3.545,"24":39.0,"40":39.0,"27":7.0,"28":3.0,"156":1.0,"29":1.0,"30":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":13.431095778692308,"appliedStats":{"53":9.287220765,"72":-1.739170744,"24":114.6011875,"25":31.433212475999998,"26":0.520833578,"42":14.0657826,"43":6.300560664000001,"44":0.090692338,"63":0.043925946},"appliedTotal":174.604245123,"externalId":"2019","id":"122019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{"23":254.4044712,"24":1146.011875,"25":5.238868746,"26":0.260416789,"27":229.0,"28":114.0,"29":57.0,"30":45.0,"31":22.0,"33":50.0,"34":25.0,"35":0.551501676,"36":0.386051173,"37":4.451523748,"38":0.151913427,"39":4.504684487,"40":88.1547596,"42":140.65

On the bright side, he probably still belongs in TE1 fantasy territory for Week 2 against the Panthers, who allowed a touchdown to the Rams' Tyler Higbee in Week 1.","3":"Howard played on 60 snaps in Week 2 but didn't record a catch, showing the rough grasp Jameis Winston has had on this new offense -- or possibly showing how the new scheme may limit him. Still, Howard's electric talent as a receiver will keep him on the fantasy landscape. Against a Giants defense that has allowed two TE touchdowns thus far, Howard will once again force us to start him in most setups. Yep, roll him out again as a fantasy TE1 and hope for the best.","4":"Howard has played on at least 75.3% of snaps in each of the first three games but enjoyed a season-best 66 yards in Week 3. His talent for blocking and receiving has him on the field as often as possible, though the Rams, Tampa Bay's Week 4 opponents, have allowed just 7.1 TE fantasy points-per-game, ranking them among the 10 toughest matchups. Still, Howard's big workload keeps him on the border of fantasy TE1 territory, with elite upside."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":4.671826625386997,"averageDraftPosition":80.29687369737391,"percentChange":-2.4982489835365698,"percentOwned":83.22444073874179,"percentStarted":50.53117181058385},"proTeamId":27,"rankings":{"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":4.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":4.833333333333333,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6}],"2":[],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":11.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":11.166666666666666,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":11.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":12.333333333333334,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6}]},"seasonOutlook":"Howard finished 2018 as the No. 14 scoring tight end, which is impressive when you consider he missed six games due to injury. Howard, who ranked sixth prior to the injury, accomplished the feat with low volume (4.7 targets per game) and elite efficiency (Howard has led the position in both YPT and YPR in both of his two NFL seasons). Howard has also scored touchdowns at an unsustainable rate (11 career TDs, 5.9 career OTD). The 24-year-old is clearly a rising star, but durability (eight missed games) and the presence of new coach Bruce Arians (his tight ends ranked 31st in fantasy points during five seasons in Arizona) are red flags.

Ingram role in the New Orleans offense, that of complementing Alvin Kamara with red-zone potential and bruiser work. Still, he's not as great a receiver as Ingram, so he may not be trusted in as many situations. On the other hand, that keeps Murray in the fantasy flex tier most weeks, as the Saints have become a run-first club and have room to make two backs fantasy-relevant. Feel free to flex him in the opener versus Houston.","2":"Murray snuck into the end zone in the first half in Week 1 but touched the ball just six times, showing he's still the No. 2 back behind Alvin Kamara. Still, inheriting Mark Ingram's role will result in many productive fantasy performances. Leave him in flex consideration for a Week 2 matchup with the Rams that should put plenty of points on the scoreboard.","3":"Drew Brees' Week 2 exit due to a thumb injury threw off the entire Saints offense, and Murray fell flat against stacked boxes and minimal work during a comeback attempt. With Teddy Bridgewater and Taysom Hill likely splitting work under center as Brees misses 6-to-8 weeks, the New Orleans offense could stall significantly. Murray's role may be in further jeopardy of losing carries if the Saints are playing from behind more often. He's still a \"cross your fingers that he scores a TD\" flex play against the Seahawks, but Seattle is a tough environment for any visitor -- let alone one with shaky QB play.","4":"Murray was in on just 20.7% of the Saints' Week 3 snaps, even with Teddy Bridgewater taking over under center for Drew Brees (thumb). The bruising back wasn't needed much as Alvin Kamara was heavily used. That may again be the case against the Cowboys, but mainly because this may be a time when the Saints play from behind. Still, the Cowboys rank middle of the pack with 23.2 RB fantasy points-per-game allowed, making Murray a capable flex choice for Week 4."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":0.8157894736842105,"averageDraftPosition":144.66863905325442,"percentChange":-14.410669708401088,"percentOwned":57.107013171947315,"percentStarted":3.7807760768956924},"proTeamId":18,"rankings":{"0":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":44,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":44,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2}],"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":37,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":37,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":37,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":39,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":33,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":43,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":37,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":32,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":29,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":36.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":35.166666666666664,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":34,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":39,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":42,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":39,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":40,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":40,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":40,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":41,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":32,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":35,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":40.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":38.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":40,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":46,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":44,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":46,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":40,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":40,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":43,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":42,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":34,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":34,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":42.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":40.166666666666664,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":41,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":44,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":42,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":44,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":41,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":43,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":39,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":39,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":34,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":40,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":42.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":40.333333333333336,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR

Murray has been between 103 and 264 receiving yards each of the past three seasons. The area where Murray has stood out is the touchdown department. Since 2015, he ranks second in the NFL in rushing touchdowns (32), fourth in rushing OTD (27.7) and fifth in carries inside the 5-yard line (40). Murray is a sneaky flex in touchdown-only leagues, but his real appeal is as arguably the most valuable handcuff in fantasy. If Kamara goes down, Murray will be in the RB1 mix.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":5.938057231750001,"appliedStats":{"53":11.20255927,"72":-0.995005978,"24":42.42583247,"25":21.683488788000002,"26":0.20859681,"42":17.176317280000003,"43":3.2445862560000003,"44":0.037971742,"63":0.02456907},"appliedTotal":95.00891570800002,"externalId":"2018","id":"102018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":105.8061264,"24":424.2583247,"25":3.613914798,"26":0.104298405,"27":84.0,"28":42.0,"29":21.0,"30":16.0,"31":8.0,"32":4.0,"33":21.0,"34":10.0,"35":0.206055654,"36":0.144238958,"37":0.497474407,"38":0.016976893,"39":4.0097708812823525,"40":28.16652778,"41":22.40511854,"42":171.7631728,"43":0.540764376,"44":0.018985871,"45":0.055004555,"46":0.035945477,"47":34.0,"48":17.0,"49":8.0,"50":6.0,"51":3.0,"52":1.0,"53":22.40511854,"54":4.0,"55":2.0,"56":0.064620455,"57":0.001998571,"58":28.23744305,"60":7.66624700036066,"61":11.40336417,"62":0.123284276,"63":0.004094845,"66":0.85986369,"67":0.182081592,"68":1.041945282,"70":0.395537298,"71":0.101965691,"72":0.497502989,"73":0.497502989,"210":16.0}},{"appliedAverage":8.088114802733335,"appliedStats":{"53":10.267518165,"72":-1.056694536,"24":56.84965442000001,"25":33.546694362,"26":0.335976258,"42":16.2672479,"43":4.994175648,"44":0.090798562,"63":0.026351262},"appliedTotal":121.32172204100002,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":140.1084962,"24":568.4965442,"25":5.591115727,"26":0.167988129,"27":113.0,"28":56.0,"29":28.0,"30":22.0,"31":11.0,"33":28.0,"34":14.0,"35":0.277833809,"36":0.194483666,"37":0.887509903,"38":0.030287308,"39":4.057545114,"40":37.74250916,"42":162.672479,"43":0.832362608,"44":0.045399281,"45":0.052741228,"46":0.034466393,"47":32.0,"48":16.0,"49":8.0,"50":6.0,"51":3.0,"53":20.53503633,"54":4.0,"55":2.0,"56":0.061584658,"57":0.00190468,"58":27.04462645,"60":7.921703979,"61":10.79983263,"62":0.21338741,"63":0.004391877,"66":0.97467282,"67":0.142853162,"68":1.117525982,"70":0.448349497,"71":0.079997771,"72":0.528347268,"73":0.528347268,"210":15.0625}},{"appliedStats":{"53":0.784774099,"72":-0.054028406,"24":2.152113896,"25":1.3396594080000002,"26":0.014260176,"42":1.1439404659999999,"43":0.29731719,"44":0.0052531,"63":0.00132},"appliedTotal":5.684609929,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":5.403720698,"24":21.52113896,"25":0.223276568,"26":0.007130088,"27":4.0,"28":2.0,"29":1.0,"33":1.0,"35":0.010405208,"36":0.007283646,"37":0.020158652,"38":6.88E-4,"39":3.982651984,"40":21.52113896,"42":11.43940466,"43":0.049552865,"44":0.00262655,"45":0.002698305,"46":0.001763342,"47":2.0,"48":1.0,"53":1.569548198,"56":0.004271101,"57":1.32E-4,"58":1.996743437,"60":7.28834239,"61":11.43940466,"62":0.009756638,"63":2.2E-4,"66":0.043385446,"67":0.012601604,"68":0.05598705,"70":0.019957305,"71":0.007056898,"72":0.027014203,"73":0.027014203,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":0.8075866795,"72":-0.064787224,"24":2.718208605,"25":1.5228401040000001,"26":0.01722,"42":1.186450047,"43":0.278844432,"44":0.004805402,"63":0.0015960000000000002},"appliedTotal":6.4727640455,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":6.795279395,"24":27.18208605,"25":0.253806684,"26":0.00861,"27":5.0,"28":2.0,"29":1.0,"30":1.0,"33":1.0,"35":0.0132,"36":0.00927,"37":0.0322,"38":0.0011,"39":4.000142521,"40":27.18208605,"42":11.86450047,"43":0.046474072,"44":0.002402701,"45":0.002709674,"46":0.001770772,"47":2.0,"48":1.0,"53":1.615173359,"56":0.004423373,"57":1.36805E-4,"58":2.068441491,"60":7.345651413,"61":11.86450047,"62":0.011008684,"63":2.66E-4,"66":0.0546,"67":0.012981904,"68":0.067598742,"70":0.0251,"71":0.007269866,"72":0.032393612,"73":0.032393612,"210":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":5.987903700615385,"appliedStats":{"53":10.40045073,"72":-0.740904498,"24":29.811544730000005,"25":18.745730532,"26":0.20246011,"42":15.16111273,"43":4.171794582,"44":0.072425578,"63":0.018133614},"appliedTotal":77.842748108,"externalId":"2019","id":"122019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{"23":74.9823133,"24":298.1154473,"25":3.124288422,"26":0.101230055,"27":59.0,"28":29.0,"29":14.0,"30":11.0,"31":5.0,"33":14.0,"34":7.0,"35":0.144876643,"36":0.10141365,"37":0.299059479,"38":0.010205753,"39":3.975810217,"40":22.93195749,"42":151.6111273,"43":0.695299097,"44":0.036212789,"45":0.039571294,"46":0.02585984,"47":30.0,"48":15.0,"49":7.0,"50":6.0,"51":3.0,"53":20.80090146,"54":4.0,"55":2.0,"56":0.056629899,"57":0.00175144,"58":25.72949007,"60":7.288680617,"61":11.66239441,"62":0.137442844,"63":0.003022269,"66":0.602018736,"67":0.167006483,"68":0.769025218,"70":0.276928618,"71":0.09352363,"72":0.370452249,"73":0.370452249,"210":13.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":0.5,"24":1.4000000000

reviews for his camp work and, while his target load may be erratic thanks to Christian McCaffrey, D.J. Moore and Greg Olsen all requiring attention, Samuel's playmaking ability after the catch could be a major asset to QB Cam Newton. Against the Rams, Samuel is a worthwhile fantasy flex choice, considering the Panthers will probably need to keep pace with this big-play offense. If reports say Newton's foot injury is an issue heading into the game -- or it keeps him out entirely -- dock Samuel appropriately.","2":"Samuel was targeted four times but came away with just 32 yards in Week 1. With Greg Olsen's back injury and a short turn-around before Week 2's Thursday game versus Tampa Bay, Samuel could gain more offensive attention. He's a solid flex play in Week 2.","3":"Samuel was targeted a whopping 13 times in Week 2 but caught just five of those passes. QB Cam Newton (foot) may miss Week 3, but Carolina probably will continue to find ways to give the playmaking wideout touches, perhaps even in the form of more handoffs. Regardless of Newton's status, consider Samuel as a solid fantasy flex against a Cardinals defense that'll be without CB Patrick Peterson (suspension).","4":"Samuel didn't miss a beat, despite Kyle Allen's debut in replacing Cam Newton (foot) for Week 3. Samuel scored his first touchdown of the season in the contest. The Texans have allowed the fifth-highest fantasy WR points-per-game to wideouts, which keeps Samuel firmly in the fantasy flex tier -- with the upside of a strong WR3 for Week 4."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":1.0557275541795665,"averageDraftPosition":133.8612268711452,"percentChange":0.00944674963749037,"percentOwned":71.63074767373227,"percentStarted":15.036920533455607},"proTeamId":29,"rankings":{"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":39,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":36,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":35,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":39,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":40,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":31,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":42,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":39,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":41,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":36,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":38.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":37.333333333333336,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"2":[],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":42,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":41,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":42,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":41,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":43,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":39,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":42,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":37,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":43,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":35,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":40.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":40.333333333333336,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":37,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":28,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":37,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":28,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":73,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":30,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":36,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":36,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":36,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":73,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":38,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":73,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":27,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":34.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":32.666666666666664,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":73,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23}]},"seasonOutlook":"Samuel has missed 10 games and registered a grand total of 54 receptions since being selected in the second round of the 2017 draft. The versatile receiver has struggled with efficiency, having hauled in 59 percent of his targets while posting a 6.6 YPT and 3.0 RAC. Samuel did make some noise in the touchdown department last season, scoring seven times on 47 touches, though his 4.4 OTD suggests he was over his head. Samuel played at least 60 percent of Carolina's snaps in five games last season and was fantasy's No. 32 WR those weeks. There's third-year breakout potential here, so Samuel is fine mid-to-late-round option.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":4.894140677615386,"appliedStats":{"53":13.00708347,"101":0.59454,"72":-0.424131584,"24":7.707010637000001,"25":1.981897164,"26":0.018248968,"42":30.666943700000004,"43":9.90388488,"44":0.15887707,"63":0.009474504},"appliedTotal":63.62382880900002,"externalId":"2018","id":"102018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":12.36266046,"24":77.07010637,"25":0.330316194,"26":0.009124484,"27":15.0,"28":7.0,"29":3.0,"30":3.0,"31":1.0,"33":2.0,"34":1.0,"35":0.022845198,"36":0.015991638,"37":0.016852599,"38":5.75115E-4,"39":6.234103623517296,"40":5.480540897,"41":26.01416694,"42":306.669437,"43":1.65064748,"44":0.079438535,"45":0.099916816,"46":0.065295639,"47":61.0,"48":30.0,"49":15.0,"50":12.0,"51":6.0,"52":3.0,"53":26.01416694,"54":5.0,"55":2.0,"56":0.145223014,"57":0.004491433,"58":43.14724143,"60":11.788554971116827,"61":21.80760441,"62":0.08856302,"63":0.001579084,"66":0.129436129,"67":0.272366379,"68":0.401802508,"70":0.059540619,"71":0.152525172,"72":0.212065792,"73":0.212065792,"101":0.09909,"114":371.5875,"210":13.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":2.5,"42":5.300000000000001,"43":6.0},"appliedTotal":13.8,"externalId":"401127962","id":"01401127962","proTeamId":29,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"41":5.0,"42":53.0,"43":1.0,"47":10.0,"48":5.0,"49":2.0,"50":2.0,"51":1.0,"53":5.0,"54":1.0,"58":7.0,"59":1.0,"60":10.6,"61":53.0,"155":1.0,"158":6.0,"183":1.0,"210":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":8.6672040444375,"appliedStats":{"53":26.631971455,"101":0.29727,"72":-0.592696792,"24":8.660817358000001,"25":5.3852949720000005,"26":0.063695842,"42":66.09347960000001,"43":31.502811504,"44":0.619716626,"63":0.012904146000000002},"appliedTotal":138.675264711,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":12.07196432,"24":86.60817358,"25":0.897549162,"26":0.031847921,"27":17.0,"28":8.0,"29":4.0,"30":3.0,"31":1.0,"33":2.0,"34":1.0,"35":0.022293841,"36":0.015605689,"37":0.020056946,"38":6.84467E-4,"39":7.174323188,"40":5.413010849,"42":660.934796,"43":5.250468584,"44":0.309858313,"45":0.130848441,"46":0.085509456,"47":132.0,"48":66.0,"49":33.0,"50":26.0,"51":13.0,"53":53.26394291,"54":10.0,"55":5.0,"56":0.919529159,"57":0.028439046,"58":88.62606564,"60":12.40867198,"61":41.30842475,"62":0.341706234,"63":0.002150691,"66":0.10111405,"67":0.446135594,"68":0.547249644,"70":0.046512463,"71":0.249835933,"72":0.296348396,"73":0.296348396,"101":0.049545,"114":355.0725,"116":35.0,"117":14.0,"210":16.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":2.1345037315,"72":-0.04537514,"24":0.47205325330000003,"25":0.221378766,"26":0.002644024,"42":5.266151167,"43":1.966715706,"44":0.038988462,"63":9.796919999999999E-4},"appliedTotal":10.0580396618,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":0.691337751,"24":4.720532533,"25":0.036896461,"26":0.001322012,"35":0.001275955,"36":8.93168E-4,"37":9.43E-4,"38":3.22E-5,"39":6.82811336,"40":4.720532533,"42":52.66151167,"43":0.327785951,"44":0.019494231,"45":0.006847916,"46":0.004475113,"47":10.0,"48":5.0,"49":2.0,"50":2.0,"51":1.0,"53":4.269007463,"56":0.110690119,"57":0.003423406,"58":7.350915725,"60":12.33577409,"61":52.66151167,"62":0.020816242,"63":1.63282E-4,"66":0.005790604,"67":0.035756951,"68":0.041547554,"70":0.002663678,"71":0.020023892,"72":0.02268757,"73":0.02268757,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":1.892711323,"72":-0.041250068,"24":0.5085127491,"25":0.21628720799999998,"26":0.002664996,"42":4.8034463590000005,"43":1.691967702,"44":0.033172646,"63":8.939999999999999E-4},"appliedTotal":9.108406915100002,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":0.7447339,"24":5.085127491,"25":0.036047868,"26":0.001332498,"27":1.0,"35":0.001375179,"36":9.62625E-4,"37":0.0011,"38":3.74E-5,"39":6.82811336,"40":5.085127491,"42":48.03446359,"43":0.281994617,"44":0.016586323,"45":0.006816685,"46":0.004454704,"47":9.0,"48":4.0,"49":2.0,"50":1.0,"53":3.785422646,"56":0.086432512,"57":0.00267317,"58":6.712098269,"60":12.68932642,"61":48.03446359,"62":0.017918821,"63":1.49E-4,"66":0.006237847,"67":0.031706473,"68":0.03794432,"70":0.002869409,"71":0.017755625,"72":0.020625034,"73":0.020625034,"210":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":9.669774498307692,"appliedStats":{"53":26.364924055,"72":-0.566340358,"24":6.351414331000001,"25":2.8622711339999998,"26":0.03338302,"42":65.54223044000001,"43":24.610214826000004,"44":0.49671948,"63":0.01225155},"appliedTotal":125.70706847800001,"externalId":"2019","id":"122019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{"23":9.301858356,"24":63.51414331,"25":0.477045189,"26":0.01669151,"27":12.0,"28":6.0,"29":3.0,"30":2.0,"31":1.0,"33":1.0,"35":0.017171959,"36":0.0120203

last summer to forgettable committee back in his second season, Freeman has the chance to prove he's a worthy backfield partner to playmaking peer Phillip Lindsay. Likely without a sizable share of the passing market, Freeman will need to prove efficient on the ground against an Oakland defense that was amongst the worst in football last season. Ultimately, Freeman's uninspiring spot in the backfield committee keeps him out of the flex tier this week.","2":"Denver's Week 2 opponent, Chicago, has allowed the fourth-fewest yards per carry (3.62) to tailbacks since the start of last season, presenting real risk for Freeman's fantasy profile given he's somewhat dependent on rushing efficiency. Without much value as a receiving threat, Freeman is a low-floor option for this Week 2 meeting with the stout Bears.","3":"Now a true peer of Phillip Lindsay in the Broncos' passing phase, Freeman joins his backfield mate in the flex tier of running backs. He'll face a Green Back defense that has been defended the pass well but has allowed 6.1 yards per carry to backs, the second-highest clip in the league.","4":"A shoulder injury saw Freeman head to the locker room for a spell early in Week 3, but he returned to action in the second quarter and gamely compiled 73 scrimmage yards on 19 touches. The Broncos are doing their best to feed both Freeman and Phillip Lindsay equally. Freeman is a flex option against a solid Jacksonville front in Week 4."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":1.328173374613003,"averageDraftPosition":129.469794183818,"percentChange":-0.6032414331577769,"percentOwned":75.5565824070903,"percentStarted":15.936102937040632},"proTeamId":7,"rankings":{"0":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":40,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":35,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":32,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":32,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":28,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":35,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":28,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":28,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":33,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":30.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":30.833333333333332,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":32,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":37,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":40,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":37,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":35,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":43,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":37,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":40,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":44,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":40,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":37.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":40.166666666666664,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":37,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":29,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":30,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":30,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":29,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":26,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":33,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":30,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":30,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":31,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":29.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":30.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":29,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":23,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":21,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":24,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":65,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":26,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":32,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":27,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":65,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":65,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":24.0,"pub

third-round pick last season, Freeman looked well on his way to a terrific rookie campaign following an impressive preseason. Instead, fellow rookie Phillip Lindsay stole the spotlight, and Freeman was left running against stacked boxes (7.1 box defenders per carry was fourth-highest) in a situational role most of the season. Freeman averaged a pedestrian 4.0 YPC, but his 2.2 YAC ranked 14th at the position. Freeman struggled as a receiver, adding only 14 catches for 72 yards (3.4 YPT) on 21 targets. Lindsay's late-season struggles and Denver's new coaching staff are expeced to lead to a larger role for Freeman, but Lindsay won't completely disappear, and Freeman's receiving woes can't be ignored. There's post-hype appeal here, but Freeman should be on benches to begin 2019.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":13.281117403571427,"appliedStats":{"53":17.67386748,"72":-2.412950124,"24":99.40818177,"25":37.322692806,"26":0.49624271,"42":28.348390970000004,"43":4.955082606,"44":0.083997864,"63":0.060137568},"appliedTotal":185.93564364999997,"externalId":"2018","id":"102018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":235.3070702,"24":994.0818177,"25":6.220448801,"26":0.248121355,"27":198.0,"28":99.0,"29":49.0,"30":39.0,"31":19.0,"32":9.0,"33":47.0,"34":23.0,"35":0.490302426,"36":0.343211698,"37":2.70753563,"38":0.092397803,"39":4.224615167130665,"40":65.99713312,"41":35.34773496,"42":283.4839097,"43":0.825847101,"44":0.041998932,"45":0.057610325,"46":0.037648347,"47":56.0,"48":28.0,"49":14.0,"50":11.0,"51":5.0,"52":2.0,"53":35.34773496,"54":7.0,"55":3.0,"56":0.118997374,"57":0.003680331,"58":46.02460613,"60":8.019860679073057,"61":18.82050853,"62":0.290120286,"63":0.010022928,"66":2.217283794,"67":0.333079494,"68":2.550363288,"70":1.019950545,"71":0.186524517,"72":1.206475062,"73":1.206475062,"210":14.0}},{"appliedAverage":8.5981803346,"appliedStats":{"53":12.850685695,"72":-1.479587366,"24":66.17346221000001,"25":28.179141438000002,"26":0.311852832,"42":18.93848321,"43":3.893008974,"44":0.068813742,"63":0.036844284000000005},"appliedTotal":128.97270501900002,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":165.2299315,"24":661.7346221,"25":4.696523573,"26":0.155926416,"27":132.0,"28":66.0,"29":33.0,"30":26.0,"31":13.0,"33":33.0,"34":16.0,"35":0.332079937,"36":0.232455956,"37":1.205617839,"38":0.041143111,"39":4.004931892,"40":43.93258902,"42":189.3848321,"43":0.648834829,"44":0.034406871,"45":0.039474034,"46":0.025796281,"47":37.0,"48":18.0,"49":9.0,"50":7.0,"51":3.0,"53":25.70137139,"54":5.0,"55":2.0,"56":0.070779445,"57":0.002189055,"58":34.26904707,"60":7.368666411,"61":12.57326686,"62":0.190333287,"63":0.006140714,"66":1.352190691,"67":0.21033208,"68":1.562522771,"70":0.622007718,"71":0.117785965,"72":0.739793683,"73":0.739793683,"210":15.0625}},{"appliedStats":{"53":1.3802974375,"72":-0.117007676,"24":5.122375366,"25":1.382155926,"26":0.01384,"42":1.982807342,"43":0.30527761800000003,"44":0.005985764,"63":0.0028859999999999997},"appliedTotal":10.078617777500002,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":12.19673155,"24":51.22375366,"25":0.230359321,"26":0.00692,"27":10.0,"28":5.0,"29":2.0,"30":2.0,"31":1.0,"33":2.0,"34":1.0,"35":0.0249,"36":0.0174,"37":0.115,"38":0.00392,"39":4.199793481,"40":51.22375366,"42":19.82807342,"43":0.050879603,"44":0.002992882,"45":0.002486967,"46":0.001625233,"47":3.0,"48":1.0,"53":2.760594875,"56":0.009096561,"57":2.81E-4,"58":3.547544269,"60":7.182536487,"61":19.82807342,"62":0.009911632,"63":4.81E-4,"66":0.0997,"67":0.022567873,"68":0.122276197,"70":0.0459,"71":0.012638009,"72":0.058503838,"73":0.058503838,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":1.437404457,"72":-0.104140154,"24":4.198045639,"25":1.217411706,"26":0.014306146,"42":2.140289443,"43":0.28593337799999996,"44":0.005123204,"63":0.0025461},"appliedTotal":9.196919919,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":10.05590052,"24":41.98045639,"25":0.202901951,"26":0.007153073,"27":8.0,"28":4.0,"29":2.0,"30":1.0,"33":2.0,"34":1.0,"35":0.020156794,"36":0.014109756,"37":0.077000435,"38":0.00263,"39":4.174708801,"40":41.98045639,"42":21.40289443,"43":0.047655563,"44":0.002561602,"45":0.002777089,"46":0.001814827,"47":4.0,"48":2.0,"49":1.0,"53":2.874808914,"56":0.010608377,"57":3.28094E-4,"58":3.705454653,"60":7.444979848,"61":21.40289443,"62":0.009714675,"63":4.2435E-4,"66":0.083971216,"67":0.024005926,"68":0.107977141,"70":0.038626759,"71":0.013443318,"72":0.052070077,"73":0.052070077,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":2.0,"24":6.300000000000001,"42":1.0},"appliedTotal":9.3,"externalId":"401127925","id":"01401127925","proTeamId":7,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":15.0,"24":63.0,"27":12.0,"28":6.0,"29":3.0,"30":2.0,"31":1.0,"33":3.0,"34":1.0,"39":4.2,"40":63.0,"41":4.0,"42":10.0,"47":2.0,"48":1.0,"53":4.0,"58":5.0,"59":19.0,"60":2.5,"61":10.0,"156":1.0,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":2.0,"24":1.6,"42":3.4000000000000004},"appliedTotal":7.0,"externalId":"401128097","id":"01401128097","proTeamId":7,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"33":1.0,"39":2.667,"40":16.0,"41":4.0,"42":34.0,"47":6.0,"48":3.0,"49":1.0,"210":1.0,"50":1.0,"53":4.0,"23":6.0,"24":16.0,"58":6.0,"59":29.0,"27":3.0,"60":8.5,"28":1.0,"156":1.0,"61":34.0}},{"appliedAverage":10.142652063615385,"appliedStats":{"53":18.965973605,"72":-1.47283533,"24":63.06484647,"25":19.117813085999998,"26":0.193504868,"42":27.496133070

run-first offense, Brees will often pop big numbers in the right matchup. Remember, he still threw for 32 touchdowns last year. The 39-year-old will host a Texans defense that just traded away pass-rusher Jadeveon Clowney, which should improve his chances of making plays. Plus, he should enjoy the addition of TE Jared Cook. Brees is safely ranked as a low-end QB1 in Week 1.","2":"Brees looked like his vintage fantasy No. 1 QB self in Week 1 while staging a late comeback win against the Texans, averaging 8.6 yards-per-attempt, which outpaces any of his single-season rates. Will he keep this going against the Rams? On the road, Brees typically breeds more distrust. Being outdoors docks him a bit, but the veteran should hover around fantasy QB1 territory for the mere fact that this should be a high-scoring affair.","3":"Brees is getting a second opinion, but the initial diagnosis of his thumb injury sustained in Week 2 says the veteran will miss 6-to-8 weeks. Fantasy managers may struggle to roster him in leagues that don't have IR spots, but he did look like his old elite self in Week 1, so it's probably worth stashing him wherever possible.

In 2018, Brees finished outside the top 10 in pass attempts, completions and yards for the first time since at least 2009.

Emmanuel Sanders has likely slowed Sutton's ascent as the team's top downfield target, yet there is still reasonable interest in using the young wideout as a flex option against an Oakland team that allowed 14 yards per reception to receivers last season, second most in the NFL.","2":"Sutton delivered his first career 100-yard game in a prime-time loss to the Raiders in Week 1. A greater challenge comes in Week 2; the Bears have allowed the fewest points per drive to opponents since the start of last season and have been solid in defending outside threats like Sutton. Given the sub-optimal matchup, Sutton is a fringe flex play.","3":"A strong Chicago defense quieted Sutton a bit this past week, but we can look to positive opportunity rates (such as leading the team with 11.5 air yards per target in Week 2) as reason to trust this second-year talent as a high-ceiling option heading into Lambeau.","4":"The lone productive receiver for the Broncos in Week 3, Sutton led the team in air yardage and actual yardage in another solid showing. The Jaguars present a stronger challenge given their tandem of top coverage corners, yet Sutton's solid usage pattern supports flex value for Week 4."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":0.9226006191950464,"averageDraftPosition":140.20151679306608,"percentChange":-3.5175453185404137,"percentOwned":69.76530421167975,"percentStarted":10.58768998767532},"proTeamId":7,"rankings":{"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":34,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":39,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":39,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":37,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":42,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":45,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":44,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":36,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":45,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":42,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":37.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":42.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":42,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":32,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":42,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":32,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":46,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":49,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":48,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":49,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":48,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":41,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":43.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":43.833333333333336,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":34,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":38,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":37,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":38,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":39,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":34,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":39,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":34,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":40,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":49,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":36.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":39.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":35,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":34,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":40,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":34,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":75,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":39,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":39,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":40,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":38,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":75,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":41,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":75,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":40,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":36.5,"published":true,"rank"

was scooped up in the second round of the 2018 draft and played a fairly substantial role as a rookie. He was on the field for 82 percent of Denver's snaps and handled 5.2 targets per game (16 percent share). Sutton was held to two top-30 fantasy weeks and underwhelmed in a full-time role down the stretch, but a 42/704/4 is solid line for a rookie, especially one who posted a 14.2 aDOT (12th highest) and dealt with 28 percent of balls thrown his way registering as off target (10th highest). Joe Flacco's presence figures to limit his upside, but it's possible Sutton passes out Emmanuel Sanders for No. 1 duties at some point this season. He's an intriguing breakout candidate and worth a mid-to-late-round flier.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":6.201814298125001,"appliedStats":{"53":21.82722634,"72":-0.511905912,"42":57.431666480000004,"43":20.130023094000002,"44":0.341241322,"63":0.010777446},"appliedTotal":99.22902877000001,"externalId":"2018","id":"102018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"41":43.65445268,"42":574.3166648,"43":3.355003849,"44":0.170620661,"45":0.148140466,"46":0.096809794,"47":114.0,"48":57.0,"49":28.0,"50":22.0,"51":11.0,"52":5.0,"53":43.65445268,"54":8.0,"55":4.0,"56":0.620472733,"57":0.019189878,"58":74.78998496,"60":13.15596988490293,"61":35.89479155,"62":0.170620661,"63":0.001796241,"67":0.45705885,"68":0.45705885,"71":0.255952956,"72":0.255952956,"73":0.255952956,"210":16.0}},{"appliedAverage":8.027055482375,"appliedStats":{"53":25.96119363,"72":-0.608858326,"42":76.7299892,"43":25.88027868,"44":0.457465894,"63":0.01281864},"appliedTotal":128.432887718,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"42":767.299892,"43":4.31337978,"44":0.228732947,"45":0.167294187,"46":0.109326751,"47":153.0,"48":76.0,"49":38.0,"50":30.0,"51":15.0,"53":51.92238726,"54":10.0,"55":5.0,"56":1.385964228,"57":0.042864873,"58":97.09563336,"60":14.77782383,"61":47.95624325,"62":0.228732947,"63":0.00213644,"67":0.543623506,"68":0.543623506,"71":0.304429163,"72":0.304429163,"73":0.304429163,"210":16.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":2.0322797455,"72":-0.038129848,"42":5.902504755,"43":1.429234284,"44":0.028023864,"63":8.04E-4},"appliedTotal":9.354716800499999,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"42":59.02504755,"43":0.238205714,"44":0.014011932,"45":0.012810976,"46":0.008371973,"47":11.0,"48":5.0,"49":2.0,"50":2.0,"51":1.0,"53":4.064559491,"56":0.148997549,"57":0.004608172,"58":7.095088538,"60":14.52188058,"61":59.02504755,"62":0.014011932,"63":1.34E-4,"67":0.034044507,"68":0.034044507,"71":0.019064924,"72":0.019064924,"73":0.019064924,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":1.9916926595,"72":-0.037368348,"42":5.821122325000001,"43":1.23429669,"44":0.022115478,"63":7.867379999999999E-4},"appliedTotal":9.032645542500001,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"42":58.21122325,"43":0.205716115,"44":0.011057739,"45":0.012498793,"46":0.008167961,"47":11.0,"48":5.0,"49":2.0,"50":2.0,"51":1.0,"53":3.983385319,"56":0.143805839,"57":0.004447603,"58":7.040363842,"60":14.6135055,"61":58.21122325,"62":0.011057739,"63":1.31123E-4,"67":0.033364597,"68":0.033364597,"71":0.018684174,"72":0.018684174,"73":0.018684174,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":2.5,"42":8.700000000000001},"appliedTotal":11.200000000000001,"externalId":"401127925","id":"01401127925","proTeamId":7,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"41":5.0,"42":87.0,"47":17.0,"48":8.0,"49":4.0,"50":3.0,"51":1.0,"53":5.0,"54":1.0,"58":7.0,"59":31.0,"60":17.4,"61":87.0,"156":1.0,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":3.0,"42":6.2,"43":12.0},"appliedTotal":21.2,"externalId":"401128097","id":"01401128097","proTeamId":7,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"41":6.0,"42":62.0,"43":2.0,"47":12.0,"48":6.0,"49":3.0,"210":1.0,"50":2.0,"51":1.0,"53":6.0,"54":1.0,"183":2.0,"58":9.0,"59":19.0,"60":10.333,"156":1.0,"61":62.0,"158":12.0}},{"appliedAverage":9.990237661846153,"appliedStats":{"53":27.92453493,"72":-0.523923078,"42":81.61415908000001,"43":20.454630324,"44":0.392657894,"63":0.011030454},"appliedTotal":129.873089604,"externalId":"2019","id":"122019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{"42":816.1415908,"43":3.409105054,"44":0.196328947,"45":0.171177147,"46":0.111864265,"47":163.0,"48":81.0,"49":40.0,"50":32.0,"51":16.0,"53":55.84906986,"54":11.0,"55":5.0,"56":2.265921481,"57":0.070080046,"58":97.49013553,"60":14.61334258,"61":62.78012237,"62":0.196328947,"63":0.001838409,"67":0.467788463,"68":0.467788463,"71":0.261961539,"72":0.261961539,"73":0.261961539,"210":13.0}},{"appliedAverage":7.206250000000001,"appliedStats":{"53":21.0,"24":-0.1,"42":70.4,"43":24.0},"appliedTotal":115.30000000000001,"externalId":"2018","id":"002018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":1.0,"24":-1.0,"39":-1.0,"40":-0.0625,"41":42.0,"42":704.0,"43":4.0,"47":134.0,"48":61.0,"49":26.0,"50":22.0,"51":7.0,"53":42.0,"54":2.0,"58":84.0,"59":14.0,"60":16.761904761904763,"61":44.0,"108":2.0,"109":2.0,"155":6.0,"156":10.0,"174":0.375,"210":16.0}},{"appliedAverage":10.9,"appliedStats":{"53":8.0,"42":24.700000000000003},"appliedTotal":32.7,"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"41":16.0,"42":247.0,"47":49

pacing all kickers in fantasy points in 2017, Zuerlein missed five games in 2018, but still managed an 11th-place finish. Zuerlein was the top-scoring kicker when active and his nine top-10 weeks were two more than the next-closest kicker during those weeks. Incredibly, Zuerlein has produced 10-plus fantasy points in 18 of 27 games during Sean McVay's two seasons as head coach. The primary reason for the success has been volume. The Rams attempted 2.65 field goals per game (second most) in 2017 and 2.68 per game (most) in 2018, which are two of the five highest totals the NFL has seen during the past decade.

threat for the Chargers over the years, Williams could set career highs in snaps and targets now that he's the clear No. 2 for the Raiders. Vertical threats like Williams can prove frustrating for fantasy purposes, especially against a solid Denver defense, thus he's not in the starting mix at the position just yet.","2":"Awesome usage led to awesome results in Week 1 for Williams, who netted WR1-like attention from Derek Carr. Williams not only led the Raiders in routes and yards, he impressively averaged 17.6 air yards per target, signalling a high-value vertical role for Oakland. The Chiefs are among the best matchups for a receiver, thus Williams is now a solid WR2 prospect ahead of Week 2.","3":"A hip pointer could slow Williams a bit, but he still profiles as a solid WR3 or flex heading into a matchup with a Vikings defense that struggled to contain the Packers' playmakers last week. There is some risk present given Minnesota's longer sample of good pass defense, but Williams' awesome share of this offense fuels strong expectations.","4":"A quiet Week 3 saw Williams barely targeted for much of the contest, but it's still worth noting he's leading the team in routes run by nearly 20 on the season and should resume a stronger workload this week against a Colts defense allowing the 11th-most fantasy points to receivers. Given an expected uptick in targets this week, Williams is back in the WR3 mix."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":6.580495356037152,"averageDraftPosition":89.27179529921654,"percentChange":-1.590915550321597,"percentOwned":86.94206838217808,"percentStarted":34.41023895742169},"proTeamId":13,"rankings":{"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":46,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":30,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":45,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":30,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":44,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":28,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":46,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":44,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":39,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":33,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":41.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":36.833333333333336,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":27,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":29,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":20,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":19.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":17.333333333333332,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":22,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":22,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":17,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":22,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":30,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":19.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":20.666666666666668,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":29,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":30,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":32,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":30,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":60,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":28,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":26,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":27,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":30,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":60,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":29,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":60,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":

heads to Oakland where - following the release of Antonio Brown - he'll take over as the team's No. 1 wideout. Williams was a full-time player, but primarily worked as a situational target throughout his four seasons with the Chargers. A Week 1 Keenan Allen injury forced Williams into No. 1 receiver duties back in 2016 and he delivered with a 69/1059/7 line and an 18th-place finish in fantasy points. That was, by far, Williams' most productive season and he's otherwise failed to eclipse five scores or post a fantasy finish better than 45th. Williams' resume suggests he won't be a high-volume target (he has been limited to a 13 percent target share each of the past two seasons), but his propensity for big plays (career 16.3 YPR) provides optimism that he can push for WR2

kept Ross out of the preseason, making it difficult to determine just how much of a role Ross will play for a depleted Cincinnati passing attack. The Seahawks were stingy against opposing receivers last season, resulting in Ross being a fade this week.","2":"Ross became the first Bengal with multiple 30-yard touchdowns in the same game since T.J. Houshmandzadeh in 2007. That included a 55-yard touchdown catch with seven seconds remaining in second quarter against the Seahawks in Week 1. He had never had that many yards in an entire game in his career.","3":"Just as we all expected, Ross is the No. 2 fantasy receiver through the first two weeks of the season. A team-leading 87 routes and a stellar 147 yards after contact have supported this surprising breakout. A blend of opportunity and play-making skills make Ross a fine flex option even against Buffalo's solid pass defense.","4":"An ugly Week 3 saw Ross secure just two of six targets, but he's still tied for the team lead in routes run and was close to a few big plays in the loss to Buffalo. He's poised for a potential bounce-back performance against the Steelers, who have allowed the seventh-most fantasy points to receivers this year."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":1.4597523219814241,"averageDraftPosition":149.9174029004834,"percentChange":-2.8929997449965157,"percentOwned":79.97781475318912,"percentStarted":31.505115208784105},"proTeamId":4,"rankings":{"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":48,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":49,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":49,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":47,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":47,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":48.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":50.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":31,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":30,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":34,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":30,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":32,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":30,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":35,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":31,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":35,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":35,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":32.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":34.833333333333336,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":33,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":33,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":35,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":34,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":31,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":37,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":36,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":33,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":34,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":39,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":32.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":35.833333333333336,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":26,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":27,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":31,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":27,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":59,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":27,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":29,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":28,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":26,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":59,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":26,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":59,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":39,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":26.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":30.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":62,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":59,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23}]},"seasonOutlook":"Ross made his name with a record 4.22-second 40-yard dash at the 2017 NFL combine, but his career is off to a rough start. Ross battled through injuries and fumbled on his only touch as a rookie before posting a bizarre 21/210/7 line on 58 targets in 2018. The 2017 ninth overall pick caught 36 percent of his targets and averaged 3.6 YPT, both of which were worst at the position. Granted, a league-high 36 percent of balls thrown his way were off target, but Ross averaged only 10.0 YPR despite a 13.9 aDOT (15th highest). He scored seven touchdowns, but his 4.8 OTD suggests that's unsustainable. Durability is a major concern for the 23-year-old, as he already has missed 16 games with various injuries. He could still turn the corner, but he's no more than a dynasty stash.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":9.352044120769232,"appliedStats":{"53":25.38551602,"72":-0.66701912,"24":4.616677926,"25":0.905992728,"26":0.006601242,"42":67.13330374,"43":23.999675646,"44":0.181454266,"63":0.014371122},"appliedTotal":121.57657357000001,"externalId":"2018","id":"102018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":7.439730637,"24":46.16677926,"25":0.150998788,"26":0.003300621,"27":9.0,"28":4.0,"29":2.0,"30":1.0,"33":1.0,"35":0.013702566,"36":0.009591796,"37":0.005516057,"38":1.88242E-4,"39":6.205436932138219,"40":2.885423704,"41":50.77103204,"42":671.3330374,"43":3.999945941,"44":0.090727133,"45":0.166123028,"46":0.108561399,"47":134.0,"48":67.0,"49":33.0,"50":26.0,"51":13.0,"52":6.0,"53":50.77103204,"54":10.0,"55":5.0,"56":0.956620393,"57":0.029586198,"58":85.06238635,"60":13.222757356421072,"61":41.95831484,"62":0.094027754,"63":0.002395187,"66":0.077893423,"67":0.531568903,"68":0.609462325,"70":0.035830974,"71":0.297678586,"72":0.33350956,"73":0.33350956,"210":13.0}},{"appliedAverage":5.668817157866667,"appliedStats":{"53":17.693968335,"72":-0.449705844,"24":2.077775877,"25":0.588395598,"26":0.007038754,"42":42.93456606,"43":21.804346680000002,"44":0.366271908,"63":0.009600000000000001},"appliedTotal":85.032257368,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":3.606158378,"24":20.77775877,"25":0.098065933,"26":0.003519377,"27":4.0,"28":2.0,"29":1.0,"35":0.006627201,"36":0.004639041,"37":0.001036104,"38":3.53582E-5,"39":5.761743271,"40":1.337803381,"42":429.3456606,"43":3.63405778,"44":0.183135954,"45":0.057910076,"46":0.037844235,"47":85.0,"48":42.0,"49":21.0,"50":17.0,"51":8.0,"53":35.38793667,"54":7.0,"55":3.0,"56":0.328898471,"57":0.0102,"58":69.48101922,"60":12.13254292,"61":27.64398619,"62":0.186655331,"63":0.0016,"66":0.037756208,"67":0.370509046,"68":0.408265254,"70":0.017367856,"71":0.207485066,"72":0.224852922,"73":0.224852922,"210":15.53125}},{"appliedStats":{"53":1.992972056,"72":-0.095342852,"24":0.0568224097,"25":0.021337446,"26":2.57172E-4,"42":5.83798902,"43":2.016412878,"44":0.033973938,"63":0.002016},"appliedTotal":9.8664380677,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":0.096652144,"24":0.568224097,"25":0.003556241,"26":1.28586E-4,"35":1.77409E-4,"36":1.24187E-4,"37":9.96168E-6,"38":3.39954E-7,"39":5.879063521,"40":0.568224097,"42":58.3798902,"43":0.336068813,"44":0.016986969,"45":0.008411547,"46":0.005496946,"47":11.0,"48":5.0,"49":2.0,"50":2.0,"51":1.0,"53":3.985944112,"56":0.14487522,"57":0.00448,"58":7.768687444,"60":14.64643973,"61":58.3798902,"62":0.017115555,"63":3.36E-4,"66":0.002023881,"67":0.083465073,"68":0.085488954,"70":9.30985E-4,"71":0.046740441,"72":0.047671426,"73":0.047671426,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":2.1334584965,"72":-0.101857314,"24":0.054530781900000005,"25":0.014791614,"26":1.866928E-4,"42":5.8701456830000005,"43":1.696993962,"44":0.028645598,"63":0.002152638},"appliedTotal":9.699048152200001,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":0.092754198,"24":0.545307819,"25":0.002465269,"26":9.33464E-5,"35":1.70248E-4,"36":1.19174E-4,"37":9.01174E-6,"38":3.07536E-7,"39":5.879063521,"40":0.545307819,"42":58.70145683,"43":0.282832327,"44":0.014322799,"45":0.006773172,"46":0.004426268,"47":11.0,"48":5.0,"49":2.0,"50":2.0,"51":1.0,"53":4.266916993,"56":0.146923634,"57":0.00454403,"58":8.214753895,"60":13.7573468,"61":58.70145683,"62":0.014416145,"63":3.58773E-4,"66":0.001942259,"67":0.089348603,"68":0.091290862,"70":8.93439E-4,"71":0.050035217,"72":0.050928657,"73":0.050928657,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":1.0,"72":-2.0,"42":2.2},"appliedTotal":1.2000000000000002,"externalId":"401127915","id":"01401127915","proTeamId":4,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"41":2.0,"42":22.0,"47":4.0,"48":2.0,"49":1.0,"53":2.0,"58":6.0,"59":2.0,"60":11.0,"61":22.0,"67":1.0,"68":1.0,"71":1.0,"72":1.0,"73":1.0,"156":1.0,"210":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":8.77497547906154,"appliedStats":{"53":23.272044515,"72":-1.116100152,"24":0.7459498548000001,"25":0.29327742599999995,"26":0.003414324,"42":66.69119778000001,"43":23.754407202,"44":0.406880164,"63":0.023610113999999998},"appliedTotal":114.07468122780001,"externalId":"2019","id":"122019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{"23":1.272731886,"24":7.459498548,"25":0.048879571,"26":0.001707162,"27":1.0,"35":0.002336208,"36":0.001635346,"37":1.35184E-4,"38":4.61333E-6,"39":5.861013331,"40":0.573807581,"42":666.9119778,"43":3.959067867,"44":0.203440082,"45":0.100727461,"46":0.065825396,"47":133.0,"48":66.0,"49":33.0,"50":26.0,"51":13.0,"53":46.54408903,"54":9.0,"55":4.0,"56":1.348961499,"57":0.0

They'll host the Buccaneers on Thursday night. Jameis Winston tossed three interceptions in his opener, and that penchant for turnovers makes Carolina a decent one-week rental for fantasy D/ST value.","3":"Carolina had three sacks and a safety in Week 2 but this D/ST stands to have a worse fate in Week 3 at the Cardinals' promising Kyler Murray-led offense. The problems may be compounded if Panthers QB Cam Newton (foot) has to miss the game, which would limit the offense's ability to retain possession. If Newton plays, this D/ST could do as a last resort. If he's out, defintiely shift to another option.","4":"QB Kyle Allen's presence actually elevated the Panthers offense, which in turn helped the defense get chances to record fantasy points with takeaways and QB takedowns. In fact, Carolina pestered Cardinals rookie QB Kyler Murray in Week 3, sacking him a whopping eight times and reeling in two interceptions. Traveling to face Deshaun Watson, DeAndre Hopkins and the Texans, however, lowers the ceiling -- except maybe in the sacks column. If your league doesn't penalize too much for points allowed, Carolina could remain a useful D/ST starter in Week 4.

position, Kelce consumes WR1-like usage on what is the league's top offense. The Jaguars allowed the 11th-fewest yards to tight ends last season and will likely bracket Kelce whenever possible in coverage, but none of that should get in the way of Kelce delivering TE1 results.","2":"Kelce earned a target on nearly 35% of his routes in Week 1, a robust rate that only again confirms what a special piece of the Chiefs' offense he's become. The Raiders have allowed 1,089 yards and nine touchdowns to tight ends in the past 17 games, all well above league average allowance. Start and enjoy.","3":"If the Ravens' defense has struggled over the past year in defending one position, it's tight end; Baltimore has allowed 1,023 yards to the position over the past 18 games, 12th-most in the league. Kelce continues to earn awesome opportunity rates even if he's yet to break out with a huge game, signaling he's due for a strong line.","4":"Quietly averaging nearly 17 yards per catch thanks to an awesome 11.3 air yards per target, Kelce is on path for yet another elite statistical campaign. The Lions have yielded the 10th-fewest yards to tight ends this season, but they've also yet to face Kelce."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":34.28637770897833,"averageDraftPosition":18.3498666222074,"percentChange":0.009218509274433018,"percentOwned":99.91982421137926,"percentStarted":99.66591047938856},"proTeamId":12,"rankings":{"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":1.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":1.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6}],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":1.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":1.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":1.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":1.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"average

set career-high marks in pass routes (530), targets (149), receptions (103), receiving yards (1,336) and touchdowns (10) last season. As incredible as that achievement is, he did this after already leading all tight ends in fantasy points each of the previous two seasons. Since missing his rookie season with a knee injury, Kelce has finished a season no lower than eighth at the position in receptions, no lower than sixth in receiving yards, no lower than 12th in touchdowns and no lower than ninth in yards per target. The three-time No. 1 fantasy tight end handled 26 percent of Kansas City's targets last season and should be in that range again in 2019. The 29-year-old is your top option at the position and worth a look in the second round of your draft.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":11.031541572125,"appliedStats":{"53":40.75,"72":-1.052197908,"24":0.7200000000000001,"25":0.6000000000000001,"26":0.004803698,"42":100.82000000000001,"43":34.2,"44":0.439820262,"63":0.022239102},"appliedTotal":176.504665154,"externalId":"2018","id":"102018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":1.8,"24":7.2,"25":0.1,"26":0.002401849,"27":1.0,"35":0.003335394,"36":0.002334776,"37":8.97856E-5,"38":3.06404E-6,"39":4.0,"40":0.450558667,"41":81.5,"42":1008.2,"43":5.7,"44":0.219910131,"45":0.194398172,"46":0.127039205,"47":201.0,"48":100.0,"49":50.0,"50":40.0,"51":20.0,"52":10.0,"53":81.5,"54":16.0,"55":8.0,"56":2.812695595,"57":0.086990585,"58":122.9,"60":12.370552147239264,"61":63.01214063,"62":0.22231198,"63":0.003706517,"66":0.020562016,"67":0.92257219,"68":0.9,"70":0.009458527,"71":0.516640427,"72":0.526098954,"73":0.526098954,"210":16.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":3.5,"42":8.9},"appliedTotal":12.4,"externalId":"401127953","id":"01401127953","proTeamId":12,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"41":7.0,"42":89.0,"47":17.0,"48":8.0,"49":4.0,"50":3.0,"51":1.0,"53":7.0,"54":1.0,"58":8.0,"59":20.0,"60":12.714,"61":89.0,"155":1.0,"210":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":14.5033527934375,"appliedStats":{"53":48.753964855,"72":-1.620363732,"42":122.84823980000002,"43":61.393138979999996,"44":0.644550346,"63":0.034114446},"appliedTotal":232.053644695,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"42":1228.482398,"43":10.23218983,"44":0.322275173,"45":0.238919771,"46":0.15613407,"47":245.0,"48":122.0,"49":61.0,"50":49.0,"51":24.0,"53":97.50792971,"54":19.0,"55":9.0,"56":4.421076282,"57":0.136734318,"58":142.2488378,"60":12.59879481,"61":76.7801499,"62":0.322275173,"63":0.005685741,"67":1.446753333,"68":1.446753333,"71":0.810181866,"72":0.810181866,"73":0.810181866,"210":16.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":3.042994115,"72":-0.07717657,"42":8.451962541,"43":4.319116038,"44":0.041865664,"63":0.0016259999999999998},"appliedTotal":15.780387787999999,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"42":84.51962541,"43":0.719852673,"44":0.020932832,"45":0.023016015,"46":0.015040966,"47":16.0,"48":8.0,"49":4.0,"50":3.0,"51":1.0,"53":6.08598823,"54":1.0,"56":0.333622445,"57":0.0103,"58":8.712526929,"60":13.88757622,"61":84.51962541,"62":0.020932832,"63":2.71E-4,"67":0.068907652,"68":0.068907652,"71":0.038588285,"72":0.038588285,"73":0.038588285,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":2.9560069315,"72":-0.07532963,"42":8.290400044,"43":4.105621182,"44":0.042150196,"63":0.0015840000000000001},"appliedTotal":15.3204327235,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"42":82.90400044,"43":0.684270197,"44":0.021075098,"45":0.022432845,"46":0.014659864,"47":16.0,"48":8.0,"49":4.0,"50":3.0,"51":1.0,"53":5.912013863,"54":1.0,"56":0.321948424,"57":0.009957168,"58":8.606591918,"60":14.02297125,"61":82.90400044,"62":0.021075098,"63":2.64E-4,"67":0.067258599,"68":0.067258599,"71":0.037664815,"72":0.037664815,"73":0.037664815,"210":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":15.050549053846153,"appliedStats":{"53":38.21726354,"72":-0.96926816,"42":104.6187299,"43":53.244779142,"44":0.52522672,"63":0.020406557999999998},"appliedTotal":195.6571377,"externalId":"2019","id":"122019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{"42":1046.187299,"43":8.874129857,"44":0.26261336,"45":0.278981214,"46":0.182314223,"47":209.0,"48":104.0,"49":52.0,"50":41.0,"51":20.0,"53":76.43452708,"54":15.0,"55":7.0,"56":3.951029794,"57":0.122196798,"58":109.9819915,"60":13.68736537,"61":80.47594605,"62":0.26261336,"63":0.003401093,"67":0.865418,"68":0.865418,"71":0.48463408,"72":0.48463408,"73":0.48463408,"210":13.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":3.5,"42":8.5},"appliedTotal":12.0,"externalId":"401128023","id":"01401128023","proTeamId":12,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"41":7.0,"42":85.0,"47":17.0,"48":8.0,"49":4.0,"210":1.0,"50":3.0,"51":1.0,"53":7.0,"54":1.0,"58":8.0,"59":27.0,"155":1.0,"60":12.143,"61":85.0}},{"appliedAverage":15.19375,"appliedStats":{"53":51.5,"72":-2.0,"42":133.6,"43":60.0},"appliedTotal":243.1,"externalId":"2018","id":"002018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"41":103.0,"42":1336.0,"43":10.0,"47":260.0,"48":125.0,"49":59.0,"50":47.0,"51":20.0,"52":5.0,"53":103.0,"54":17.0,"55":2.0,"56":5.0,"58":150.0,"59":75.0,"60":12.970873786407767,"61":83.5,"67":2.0,"68":2.0,"71":1.0,"72":1.0,"73":1.0,"108":2.0,"109":2.0,"155":12.0,"156":4.0,"174":0.75,"210":16.0}},{"appliedAverage":14.300000000000002,"appliedStats":{"53":8.5,"42":28.400000000000002,"43":6.

70 yards in 14 games last season, Allen has emerged as one of the most consistent weekly PPR performers in fantasy football. The Colts allowed the second-fewest yards to receivers last season and claim a talented secondary, but arguably lack the top cover talent requisite to slow down Allen. Given what should be a heavy workload at home this week, Allen remains firmly in the WR1 class.","2":"Allen was close to an even bigger opener as he almost had a second touchdown in the contest, but managers will gladly take his unique blend of volume (10 targets) and efficiency (eight receptions). Allen could net strong coverage from the Lions' talented corners, but as the top target of Philip Rivers with such a strong and longstanding rapport, it's best to trust the larger sample of success for Allen this week.","3":"Leading the NFL in air yardage through two weeks, Allen's 221 actual yards are the sixth-most through two games by a Charger and the most since Tony Martin's 230 in 1995.  The Texans struggle at outside cornerback, setting up Allen for another strong WR1 performance.","4":"Allen has produced the most fantasy points among skill players in ESPN PPR formats this season in part thanks to delivering his 10th career game with 10 receptions this past Sunday. The Dolphins have some talent at cornerback, but have still proven uniquely susceptible to big receiving plays. Allen is in a great spot to meet and even exceed his projection this week."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":34.1687306501548,"averageDraftPosition":20.79361773037827,"percentChange":0.07870069825719384,"percentOwned":99.85403912890553,"percentStarted":98.28136414318121},"proTeamId":24,"rankings":{"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":10.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":9.166666666666666,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":4.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":4.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":4.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":4.333333333333333,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":1.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":

missing 26 games (including at least one each season) during his first four NFL seasons, Allen has appeared in all 32 of the Chargers games during the past two regular seasons. In fact, he has been on the field for 91 percent of the team's pass plays and has handled a hefty 28 percent target share. Allen has finished no lower than 13th at the position in targets, receptions, receiving yards and fantasy points during each of the past two seasons. If there's a concern area, it's touchdowns, as Allen hasn't scored more than six in a season since his rookie campaign in 2013. Allen's 5.4 OTD last season suggests he was fortunate to even reach six scores. Allen is in his prime at age 27 and one of the game's most effective receivers. Philip Rivers' top target is a safe back-end

for a team to juggle talented pass-catchers like Woods, Brandin Cooks and Cooper Kupp with a workhorse back like Todd Gurley II, but this Rams team is as fantasy-friendly as it gets. Woods had a breakout campaign for Los Angeles last season and is all set to repeat his efforts in 2019. That begins in Week 1 when he'll take on the mediocre Panthers pass defense (fifth-most touchdowns allowed through the air), making him a solid WR2 pick.","2":"Woods led the Rams in targets, catches and yards in Week 1 --  an encouraging sign for a receiver who is one of three talented players at his position. He didn't make any splash plays, but he was targeted downfield and will have bigger games down the road this season. You drafted Woods for a reason, so keep him locked in as a WR2 this week against the Saints.","3":"Woods has yet to produce any big plays this season like teammates Cooper Kupp and Brandin Cooks have, but his time will almost certainly come. This offense is always going to have its ups and downs for various players as the ball is spread around between three amazing wideouts and a talented running back. So far, Woods has been on the wrong side of most of the offensive production. Don't lose hope. The Browns are an appealing matchup in Week 3, so start Woods as a WR2 and don't worry about him moving forward.","4":"The Rams have an impressive wide receiver trio, but Woods currently appears to be third in line among that group. He lacks the explosive plays of Brandin Cooks and the volume of Cooper Kupp, but only barely in both regards. He could find a big play at any moment in this talented offense, and he's only eight targets behind Kupp through three games. Don't panic! Continue to start him as a high-end WR3/flex pick this week against a Buccaneers team that struggled against rookie Daniel Jones in Week 3."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":15.3359133126935,"averageDraftPosition":60.325693807817316,"percentChange":-1.534556591862824,"percentOwned":95.74265546658845,"percentStarted":61.89514664859161},"proTeamId":14,"rankings":{"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":21,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":17,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":20,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":22,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":19.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":17.333333333333332,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":12.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":12.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":21,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":23,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":23,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":17,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":27,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":23,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":22.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":19.166666666666668,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":23,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":23,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":23,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":23,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":48,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":24,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":22,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":21,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":24,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":48,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":48,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":17,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":23.0,"published":

reigning No. 11 scoring wide receiver, the sure-handed Woods has averaged a healthy 24 percent target share during his two seasons with the Rams. During the seven full games Woods, Brandin Cooks and Cooper Kupp played together last season, Woods paced the team with a 24 percent share (7.9 per game) and ranked 11th in fantasy points. Woods ranked second among all receivers in snaps (996) and was top 10 in touches (105) and scrimmage yards (1376). The concerns with Woods are touchdowns (he has never cleared six touchdown receptions or eight end zone targets in a season) and durability (he has missed at least two games in four of six NFL seasons). Nonetheless, he's the No. 1 receiver in Sean McVay's high-scoring offense and thus a solid

The 2015 third-round pick has yet to clear 167 carries or 32 receptions in a single season but has delivered strong efficiency (4.4 YPC and 11.0 YPR in 56 career games) and touchdown production (29 scores). In fact, Coleman is one of only five players who have scored eight or more offensive touchdowns each of the past three seasons. He found pay dirt 11 times in 2016, when current 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan was the Falcons' OC.

himself in 2018, only over just 13 games. He still posted his highest yardage (843) since 2014 and has 15 touchdowns across his past two seasons, so he has a useful place on many fantasy squads. His ceiling in this crowded Eagles pass-catching picture, however, remains questionable. Against the Redskins, however, he's ranked as a fantasy WR3. He logged 5-59-1 against them in Week 17 last season.","2":"Jeffery both caught and ran for a score in Week 1, taking a backseat to DeSean Jackson's 2-TD aerial show in his return. Jeffery held his own, though, coming through on his typical WR3 fantasy value. He may have to deal with Desmond Trufant in Week 2, but Jeffery succeeded with Josh Norman looming over him for much of the opener. Keep Jeffery in fantasy WR3 territory.","3":"Jeffery (calf) could miss the next two game since Week 4's schedule has the Eagles playing on Thursday. He failed to register any Week 2 stats because he left the game early. His fantasy shareholders must begin prepping for a possible absence. In-house, they have WR Nelson Agholor (the best pickup). Other choices include Mack Hollins and rookie JJ Arcega-Whiteside, but their consistency questions might not make them the best avenues.","4":"Jeffery (calf) didn't suit up for Week 3 and is questionable for the quick turnaround game on Thursday against the Packers. If he does play, expect less than his typical high-end WR3 fantasy ceiling, especially because the Packers have been one of the stingiest fantasy defenses against receivers (23.6 points-per-game, the second-lowest mark)."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":9.308049535603715,"averageDraftPosition":76.86971742935734,"percentChange":-1.8679995047577194,"percentOwned":91.96771593669635,"percentStarted":26.166723150487137},"proTeamId":21,"rankings":{"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":24,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":24,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":27,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":27,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":28,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":23,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":28,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":26,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":27,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":25.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":26.166666666666668,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":21,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":21,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":16.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":19.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":50,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":50.833333333333336,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"4":[]},"seasonOutlook":"Jeffery has posted a pair of solid fantasy seasons since joining the Eagles, but he has done it two different ways. In 2017, a massive 28 percent of balls thrown his direction were off target, which led to an ugly 48 percent catch rate. He still posted a 57/789/9 line and finished 21st in fantasy points. In 2018, Jeffery missed three games and was targeted closer to the line of scrimmage more often, which allowed a healthy 71 percent catch rate and 65/840/6 line. Jeffery was fantasy's No. 17 WR after returning in Week 4. The rangy receiver has reached double digits in end zone targets during each of the past six seasons and is the top perimeter option in a strong Eagles' offense.

arguably the NFL's top offense signals real upside for Watkins. The \"if\" always comes next with Watkins, who hasn't been able to stay on the field for much of his career. That said, Watkins enters the season healthy and should be afforded some worthy vertical looks as the Jaguars roll coverage over the Tyreek Hill.","2":"Watkins set career-highs with 198 receiving yards and three scores, both good for the most by Chiefs player in a season-opener in franchise history. With Tyreek Hill sidelined and Watkins flush with valuable looks from Patrick Mahomes, he's suddenly reentered the WR1 tier for this trip to face a suspect Oakland secondary.","3":"Watkins was dealt with a team-high 13 targets in Week 2 and now sits 12th in the league in air yardage. With awesome opportunity rates in the league's best offense, Watkins is in a good spot to overcome a tough matchup with the Ravens' secondary.","4":"Even as his lines have been somewhat quiet since Week 1's amazing output, Watkins remains the team's leader in routes run and targets the past two weeks. This signals some big plays are going to resurface for Watkins and Patrick Mahomes. The Lions have some capable coverage talent at cornerback, but Watkins' strong share of the Chiefs' offense merits trust from fantasy managers."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":6.53405572755418,"averageDraftPosition":74.11083333333333,"percentChange":0.16196814328358755,"percentOwned":98.31245078396779,"percentStarted":80.479764645908},"proTeamId":12,"rankings":{"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":32,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":35,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":36,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":35,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":38,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":41,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":40,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":34,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":37,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":31,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":34.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":36.666666666666664,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":8.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":8.333333333333334,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":8.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":10.666666666666666,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":9.5,"published":tru

hasn't posted a top 40 fantasy season since 2015, but injuries have been a big culprit. The 2014 first-round pick averaged a 21 percent target share (6.9 per game) during the 10 games he played in full last season. Believe it or not, he trailed Tyreek Hill (73) by only four targets during those weeks. Eight of the 10 games came during the regular season and Watkins was fantasy's No. 16 scoring wideout those weeks. Watkins posted a healthy 9.4 YPT despite a career-low 8.4 aDOT. Bizarrely, he was limited to one end zone target, which explains his three touchdowns. Watkins' durability is an obvious concern (he has missed at least three games during three of the past four seasons) but he plays a big role in arguably the league's best offense, which makes him a WR3 with WR2

and fast -- characteristics fantasy managers typically like in a wide receiver. However, he's also young, unproven, and has been dealing with some nagging injuries -- things no one wants to hear heading into a rookie's first pro game. The Bengals offer up a fantastic matchup for the Seattle passing game, as they allowed the most passing yards in the league a year ago. That means a healthy, starting Metcalf is a wild-card flex play for those willing to take a bit of a risk. If not, he's still definitely a player to keep on your bench to see what sort of role he earns.","2":"Metcalf is an exciting prospect who got a few chances to show what he can do in his pro debut. He saw three times as many targets as any other Seattle receiver or tight end in Week 1 and finished with a team-high 89 yards receiving. He even flashed his big-play potential with a 42-yard grab. It was a great start for the rookie and we can expect more of the same in Week 2 against a Steelers defense that allowed three touchdowns to receivers in Week 1. He's a flex option in all formats.","3":"Metcalf is quickly becoming a must-start player in Seattle's offense, as he's nearly doubled the yards-per-catch of fellow wideout Tyler Lockett through two weeks. He also found the end zone for his first NFL touchdown in Week 2. Tight ends and running backs are involved in the Seattle passing game, but when Russell Wilson is looking down the field, Metcalf is one of only two options he'll consider on a regular basis.  The Ole Miss product and Lockett have combined for 27 targets while no other wideout has more than three. Against a Saints team that has allowed quite a few big plays in the passing game already this season, that makes Metcalf an appealing, high-upside flex option.","4":"In Week 1, it seemed like Metcalf might have already carved out a bigger role than Tyler Lockett in the Seattle offense, but those tides have turned quickly. The rookie out of Ole Miss is seeing a respectable 6-7 targets each week, but it's Lockett who has quickly risen back to the top of the receiving charts in Seattle. Metcalf is a great red-zone target and is producing decent numbers when he catches the ball, so against an Arizona team that's allowed the eight-most passing yards so far this season, he's someone to consider for your flex spot."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":0.8312693498452013,"averageDraftPosition":145.76039323502457,"percentChange":-2.6301429935969054,"percentOwned":66.32055072874445,"percentStarted":14.443386762489329},"proTeamId":26,"rankings":{"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":46,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":42,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":42,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":45,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":46.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":49.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":44,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":42,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":47,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":42,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":44,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":40,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":49,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":44,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":39,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":44,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":45.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":45.166666666666664,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":46,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":47,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":46,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":47,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":44,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":43,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":45,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":44,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":36,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":41,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":45.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":43.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":40,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":43,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":45,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":43,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":43,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":38,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":43,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":37,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":40,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":45,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":39.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":43.166666666666664,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}]},"seasonOutlook":"The Seahawks selected Metcalf with the final pick of the second round of April's draft. Metcalf is huge (6-foot-3, 228 pounds) with terrific explosiveness, speed and downfield play-making ability. The former Ole Miss star is young (he turns 22 in December) and raw, the latter of which can somewhat be attributed to injury woes. Metcalf showed off his speed and size at the combine with a 4.33 40-yard dash and 27 bench reps, though he did raise major red flags by struggling in quickness events. Metcalf has the upside to become one of the league's next premiere vertical receivers, especially with Russell Wilson on the other end of the battery, but he figures to be more boom/bust than a consistent producer as a situational deep threat in Seattle's super-run-heavy offense in

against the Jets as a rookie, Allen failed to throw a touchdown and turned the ball over three times. A debacle? Hardly. Allen ran for 101 yards and a score. We can expect a Gregg Williams defense to prove blitz-heavy, meaning the dual-threat quaterback could be on the move, but there still is clearly risk in trusting Allen as a passer on the road in Week 1. He's firmly in the QB2 tier.","2":"Four turnovers weakened Allen's fantasy output for the Bills in Week 1, but another strong day on the ground helped salvage his outing. If you can stomach the negative plays, Allen is primed for a positive Week 2 showing against the Giants, who surrendered the seventh-most points per drive to opponents and allowed the seventh-most rushing yards to quarterbacks.","3":"Another game, another rushing score for Buffalo's second-year signal-caller, who now leads quarterbacks in rushing touchdowns since the start of last season with 10. We're also seeing solid passing results emerge for Allen; he's averaged 253.5 through two weeks and next hosts a Bengals defense that has allowed 11 yards per attempt to opposing arms this season. Only the Dolphins (11.9) have allowed more. Given the floor his rushing production helps support, Allen is a viable starting option at home this week.","4":"The Bills are 3-0 for the first time since 2011 thanks to Josh Allen orchestrating two game-winning drives.  Among quarterbacks this season, Allen’s 105 rush yards trail only Lamar Jackson (172) and his 78 scramble yards are just behind Gardner Minshew (81). In fact, no one has more scramble yards than Allen since he entered the league last year, and his five scramble TDs are three more than any other quarterback. The Patriots have the second-highest sack rate, so Allen will be busy scrambling to another QB1 performance."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":0.29102167182662536,"averageDraftPosition":157.81408920383493,"percentChange":-0.3751126800433724,"percentOwned":68.77586086231202,"percentStarted":26.69940769073658},"proTeamId":2,"rankings":{"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":20,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":20,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":19.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":18.666666666666668,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":20,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":9.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":9.666666666666666,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":6.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":6.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":14.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":14.666666666666666,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}]},"seasonOutlook":"Allen's rookie season was as expected on one hand and anything but on the other. The expected part was his struggles as a passer. Allen posted an ugly 10-to-12 TD/INT mark and ranked dead last in both completion percentage (53 percent) and off-target rate (22 percent). His 6.5 yards per attempt was fourth worst despite a league-high 11.2 aDOT. The surprising aspect was Allen's elite rushing production. Allen carried the ball 89 times for 631 yards and 8 touchdowns and his 7.1 yards per carry topped the position. The latter allowed Allen the most fantasy points at the position once he returned from injury in Week 12 through Week 17. Allen's passing struggles make him a risky fantasy investment, but he's worth a late-round flier because of his rushing contributions.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":11.974062062166666,"appliedStats":{"19":0.982716424,"4":49.60340832,"20":-27.61742306,"8":106.0,"72":-5.881582664,"24":12.69983835,"25":7.704902442,"26":0.051684934,"63":0.1452},"appliedTotal":143.688744746,"externalId":"2018","id":"102018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":401.2559239,"1":237.7689766,"2":163.48694730000003,"3":2663.446596,"4":12.40085208,"5":532.0,"6":266.0,"7":133.0,"8":106.0,"9":53.0,"10":26.0,"11":47.0,"12":23.0,"13":32.0,"14":16.0,"15":2.042121632,"16":1.334526486,"17":1.754793661,"18":0.237026612,"19":0.491358212,"20":13.80871153,"21":0.59256191,"22":205.5921726,"23":36.28493156,"24":126.9983835,"25":1.284150407,"26":0.025842467,"27":25.0,"28":12.0,"29":6.0,"30":5.0,"31":2.0,"32":1.0,"33":7.0,"34":3.0,"35":0.068401261,"36":0.047880882,"37":0.057998317,"38":0.00198,"39":3.500030950588901,"40":9.803040025,"62":0.517200679,"63":0.0242,"64":32.11845451,"65":5.671573349,"66":0.474861139,"68":6.146434488,"69":2.722355208,"70":0.218436124,"72":2.940791332,"73":16.74950286,"210":12.0}},{"appliedAverage":17.23939796413333,"appliedStats":{"19":2.068530352,"4":68.78485432,"20":-28.25386914,"8":130.0,"72":-9.063717388,"24":54.666311840000006,"25":39.7783683,"26":0.386386606,"63":0.224104572},"appliedTotal":258.590969462,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":473.2274012,"1":271.9285212,"2":201.29888,"3":3264.914819,"4":17.19621358,"5":652.0,"6":326.0,"7":163.0,"8":130.0,"9":65.0,"10":32.0,"11":54.0,"12":27.0,"15":2.32589399,"16":1.519971722,"17":1.798140829,"18":0.242881678,"19":1.034265176,"20":14.12693457,"21":0.574625477,"22":212.0074558,"23":95.77252159,"24":546.6631184,"25":6.62972805,"26":0.193193303,"27":109.0,"28":54.0,"29":27.0,"30":21.0,"31":10.0,"33":19.0,"34":9.0,"35":0.185362718,"36":0.129753902,"37":0.81607041,"38":0.027849352,"39":5.707932811,"40":35.49760509,"62":1.227458479,"63":0.037350762,"64":36.47366693,"65":8.000686622,"66":1.503324164,"68":9.504010786,"69":3.840329578,"70":0.691529116,"72":4.531858694,"73":18.65879327,"210":15.4}},{"appliedStats":{"20":-6.0,"8":6.0,"24":2.6,"25":6.0},"appliedTotal":8.6,"externalId":"401127866","id":"01401127866","proTeamId":2,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"0":28.0,"64":4.0,"1":13.0,"2":15.0,"3":153.0,"68":1.0,"5":30.0,"6":15.0,"7":7.0,"8":6.0,"9":3.0,"73":3.0,"10":1.0,"11":2.0,"12":1.0,"13":3.0,"14":1.0,"210":1.0,"20":3.0,"21":46.43,"22":153.0,"23":5.0,"24":26.0,"25":1.0,"27":5.0,"28":2.0,"156":1.0,"29":1.0,"158":6.0,"30":1.0,"33":1.0,"39":5.2,"40":26.0,"179":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"19":0.134195712,"4":3.945846012,"20":-2.675403262,"8":8.0,"72":-0.758600528,"24":4.236843379,"25":3.31286199,"26":0.027785938,"63":0.018779999999999998},"appliedTotal":16.242309241,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"0":32.77590679,"1":19.57880994,"2":13.19709686,"3":217.5916413,"4":0.986461503,"5":43.0,"6":21.0,"7":10.0,"8":8.0,"9":4.0,"10":2.0,"11":3.0,"12":1.0,"15":0.163003489,"16":0.10652278,"17":0.135358498,"18":0.018283384,"19":0.067097856,"20":1.337701631,"21":0.597353723,"22":217.5916413,"23":7.234447875,"24":42.36843379,"25":0.552143665,"26":0.013892969,"27":8.0,"28":4.0,"29":2.0,"30":1.0,"33":1.0,"35":0.01415504,"36":0.009908528,"37":0.0784,"38":0.00268,"39":5.856484769,"40":42.36843379,"62":0.080990825,"63":0.00313,"64":2.28241241,"65":0.659740811,"66":0.136140597,"68":0.795881409,"69":0.316675589,"70":0.062624675,"72":0.379300264,"73":1.717001895,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"19":0.167159156,"4":5.006984972,"20":-1.749568678,"8":8.0,"72":-0.613221926,"24":4.347571036000001,"25":4.039472664,"26":0.033253646,"63":0.015184800000000002},"appliedTotal":19.246835670000003,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"0":28.52721883,"1":16.69005636,"2":11.83716248,"3":203.9601132,"4":1.251746243,"5":40.0,"6":20.0,"7":10.0,"8":8.0,"9":4.0,"10":2.0,"11":3.0,"12":1.0,"15":0.144889102,"16":0.094685028,"17":0.110333713,"18":0.014903192,"19":0.083579578,"20":0.874784339,"21":0.585057255,"22":203.9601132,"23":7.422436347,"24":43.47571036,"25":0.673245444,"26":0.016626823,"27":8.0,"28":4.0,"29":2.0,"30":1.0,"33":1.0,"35":0.01454653,"36":0.010182571,"37":0.082594754,"38":0.002818642,"39":5.857336908,"40":43.47571036,"62":0.1002064,"63":0.0025308,"64":2.374466377,"65":0.519248543,"66":0.124721006,"68":0.643969549,"69":0.249239301,"70":0.057371663,"72":0.306610963,"73":1.181395303,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"19":2.0,"4":4.0,"20":-2.0,"8":9.0,"24":4.6000000000000005},"appliedTotal":17.6,"externalId":"401127915","id":"01401127915","proTeamId":2,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"0":36.0,"1

D/ST","id":-16014,"injured":false,"lastName":"D/ST","outlooks":{"outlooksByWeek":{"1":"The NFC West has been a goldmine for D/ST units in recent years, and the Rams stand out as the pick from the current crop. This group has finished near the top of the leaderboard among D/STs for two straight seasons and there's no reason to pick against them in 2019. With some new faces like Eric Weddle and Clay Matthews joining an already solid core, this is a \"set it and-forget it\" D/ST for the entire season. Well, as long as you don't forget about their bye week!","2":"Remember, splash plays like turnovers forced, touchdowns scored and sacks made matter more for a fantasy D/ST's long-term value than points allowed. So, while the Rams may have ceded 27 points on the scoreboard in Week 1, they picked up three sacks, made two fumble recoveries and an interception to help rack up nine fantasy points. That's what you should expect most weeks from this talented defense. They're a set-and-forget option, and Week 2 against Detroit is no exception.","3":"Baker Mayfield is certainly prone to throwing interceptions -- four so far this year. The Browns offensive line, plus Mayfield's style of play, can certainly lead to sacks -- eight over the first two games. The Rams are already one of the premier D/STs in fantasy, so having any sort of appealing matchup makes them a must-start in all leagues. Don't hesitate to plug them in to your lineup.","4":"The Rams have been the seventh-best D/ST so far this season, and it would be an upset for them to ever leave the top 10. They've got the right combination of playmakers who create turnovers, sack the quarterback and also keep points allowed low. This unit is a good pick almost any week - and this week is no different, as they host a very turnover-prone Buccaneers squad.

The Rams have ranked top-six in forced turnovers, interceptions, blocks and D/ST touchdowns both seasons. Ndamukong Suh and Lamarcus Joyner were notable offseason losses, but the team remains strong up front with Aaron Donald and added Eric Weddle in the secondary. A new-look pass rush (Dante Fowler Jr., Clay Matthews) is improved from last season, and the secondary remains a strength of the roster.

crowded depth chart, it's fine to leave Burkhead in fantasy free agency for this meeting with a solid Pittsburgh rush defense.","2":"With more targets and touches than James White in Week 1, Burkhead reemerged as a playmaker for the Pats against the Steelers. It's always tough to predict this backfield breakdown, but for those in deeper leagues, there is some growing appeal for Burkhead given his rewarding gadget role in a top offense. Without a defined role just yet, it's best to consider Burkhead a savvy stash for now.","3":"With a real role carved out in this offense, Burkhead leads the team through two weeks in scrimmage yards per game (76.5). There likely isn't a very high ceiling for Burkhead as part of a three-man committee backfield, however.","4":"Leading the Patriots with 74 scrimmage yards per game thanks to strong receiving production, this versatile vet led the team's backfield in snap percentage last week. The return of James White to the fold will cut into Burkhead's receiving potential, but he's entering the streaming tier of tailbacks thanks to his dual-threat role for the Patriots. The Bills have been solid against tailbacks this season, adding some risk to Burkhead's profile."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":0.19504643962848298,"averageDraftPosition":165.65819303217202,"percentChange":25.39770600957591,"percentOwned":40.00702038689025,"percentStarted":11.031477107913885},"proTeamId":17,"rankings":{"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":50,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":50,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":46,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":44,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":37,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":49.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":47.666666666666664,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":34,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":30,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":27,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":32,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":34,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":21,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":30.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":27.333333333333332,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":32,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":31,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":34,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":31,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":32,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":39,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":41,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":33,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":30,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":29,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":34.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":32.833333333333336,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":33,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}]},"seasonOutlook":"Burkhead has appeared in 23 games across two seasons with the Patriots, handling roughly one quarter of the carries and just under 10 percent of the targets during both seasons. Last season's 3.3 YPC was both the worst of his career and fourth-worst at the position, but note that he has finished second and first, respectively, in average box defenders each of the past two seasons. The 29-year-old is a competent rusher and effective receiver with a defined role in one of the league's best offenses. He has little standalone value, and that's doubtful to change with James White, Sony Michel and Damien Harris all on the

emerged as the best rookie receiver from the Packers' draft class in 2018, handling a decent workload in terms of targets and hauling in a couple of touchdowns. With Randall Cobb no longer on the team, there's an opening for the role of No. 2 receiver behind Davante Adams, and the USF product is considered the front-runnner to claim that spot. However, it's an open audition and he's not yet proven himself, so he's a bit of a flex flier for now until his role becomes more obvious -- especially against a tough Bears defense.","2":"Valdes-Scantling played the second-most snaps of any Packers wideout (or any pass-catcher for that matter) and led Green Bay in both catches and yards in an ugly win over the Bears. That's an encourgaing sign, to be sure, but he's still a distant second to Davante Adams at the WR position and he will likely fall behind TE Jimmy Graham when the Packers are in the red zone. As such, he's one to keep on the bench -- especially in Week 2 against a solid Minnesota defense -- in the hopes of a breakout somewhere down the line this season.","3":"Valdes-Scantling is locked in as the No. 2 receiver for Green Bay, which is a great role for fantasy purposes. He's absolutely a name to consider -- in the future. However, the Packers' run of three impossible matchups concludes this week as they take on Denver's elite pass defense. Keep Valdes-Scantling on your bench against a team that has allowed only one passing touchdown over 2019's first two weeks.","4":"Tied for No. 1 in targets with Davante Adams, Valdes-Scantling seems to be locked in as the Packers' No. 2 wideout. He will see a healthy amount of looks in what should be an improving passing offense. After facing three consecutive defenses that are very strong against the pass, Week 4 brings with it a matchup with the Eagles, who have allowed at least one 100-yard receiver in each of the first three games. Look for Valdes-Scantling to show up regularly when Aaron Rodgers drops back to pass, making him a flex pick for Week 4."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":0.9071207430340558,"averageDraftPosition":139.45457576262712,"percentChange":16.144667191477986,"percentOwned":66.66996558210668,"percentStarted":26.998893558001342},"proTeamId":9,"rankings":{"0":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":47,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4}],"1":[],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":43,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":49.666666666666664,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":49,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":48,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":48,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":49,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":49.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":50.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":53,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":53,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":53,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":55,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":53,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23}]},"seasonOutlook":"The Packers drafted a trio of wide receivers in the mid-to-late rounds of the 2018 draft and fifth-rounder Valdes-Scantling emerged as the top producer of the three. Valdes-Scantling posted a 38/581/2 line and a solid 8.2 YPT despite 31 percent of balls thrown his way registering as off target (fifth highest). He averaged 5.7 yards after the catch, which was 11th best at the position. Especially with Randall Cobb gone, the Packers' wide receiver depth chart is wide open. Valdes-Scantling, who stands 6-foot-5 and aligned in the slot on 46 percent of his routes as a rookie, will have a shot at flex value if he locks down No. 2 or perhaps No. 3 duties in Green Bay's Aaron Rodgers-led offense. He's worth a mid-round flier.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":1.3903666470625,"appliedStats":{"53":4.720537781,"72":-0.110709036,"42":11.930451940000001,"43":5.6356767660000004,"44":0.067580902,"63":0.002328},"appliedTotal":22.245866353,"externalId":"2018","id":"102018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"41":9.441075562,"42":119.3045194,"43":0.939279461,"44":0.033790451,"45":0.126034101,"46":0.082363285,"47":23.0,"48":11.0,"49":5.0,"50":4.0,"51":2.0,"52":1.0,"53":9.441075562,"54":1.0,"56":0.048462825,"57":0.00149885,"58":16.15100446,"60":12.636750825318732,"61":7.45653246,"62":0.033790451,"63":3.88E-4,"67":0.098847354,"68":0.098847354,"71":0.055354518,"72":0.055354518,"73":0.055354518,"210":16.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":1.5,"42":4.7},"appliedTotal":6.2,"externalId":"401127863","id":"01401127863","proTeamId":9,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"41":3.0,"42":47.0,"47":9.0,"48":4.0,"49":2.0,"210":1.0,"50":1.0,"53":3.0,"58":7.0,"59":20.0,"60":15.667,"156":1.0,"61":47.0}},{"appliedAverage":7.6362456769375004,"appliedStats":{"53":24.29549572,"72":-0.606883358,"24":2.050794321,"25":0.560692788,"26":0.00718954,"42":68.749501,"43":26.690551542,"44":0.41964246,"63":0.012946817999999999},"appliedTotal":122.17993083100001,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":3.850576968,"24":20.50794321,"25":0.093448798,"26":0.00359477,"27":4.0,"28":2.0,"29":1.0,"35":0.00707744,"36":0.004954208,"37":0.001015901,"38":3.46688E-5,"39":5.325940341,"40":1.281746451,"42":687.49501,"43":4.448425257,"44":0.20982123,"45":0.191965682,"46":0.125449573,"47":137.0,"48":68.0,"49":34.0,"50":27.0,"51":13.0,"53":48.59099144,"54":9.0,"55":4.0,"56":1.026131317,"57":0.03173602,"58":84.18089831,"60":14.14861046,"61":42.96843812,"62":0.213416001,"63":0.002157803,"66":0.040315252,"67":0.508744041,"68":0.549059293,"70":0.018545016,"71":0.284896663,"72":0.303441679,"73":0.303441679,"210":16.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":2.0378886935,"72":-0.04008353,"24":0.1410811156,"25":0.045310824,"26":5.1817E-4,"42":5.676443627,"43":2.23012206,"44":0.037243648,"63":8.520000000000001E-4},"appliedTotal":10.1293766081,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":0.23987542,"24":1.410811156,"25":0.007551804,"26":2.59085E-4,"35":4.40885E-4,"36":3.08619E-4,"37":7.69E-5,"38":2.62E-6,"39":5.881432776,"40":1.410811156,"42":56.76443627,"43":0.37168701,"44":0.018621824,"45":0.011579756,"46":0.00756737,"47":11.0,"48":5.0,"49":2.0,"50":2.0,"51":1.0,"53":4.075777387,"56":0.134778935,"57":0.00417,"58":6.996083582,"60":13.92726611,"61":56.76443627,"62":0.01888091,"63":1.42E-4,"66":0.002009182,"67":0.034138467,"68":0.036147649,"70":9.24224E-4,"71":0.019117542,"72":0.020041765,"73":0.020041765,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":1.591867128,"72":-0.039996684,"24":0.16814346540000003,"25":0.041537388,"26":5.18224E-4,"42":4.388023034,"43":1.8439493219999998,"44":0.029416884,"63":8.520000000000001E-4},"appliedTotal":8.024310761399999,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":0.276486597,"24":1.681434654,"25":0.006922898,"26":2.59112E-4,"35":5.08347E-4,"36":3.55843E-4,"37":1.11589E-4,"38":3.81E-6,"39":6.081432776,"40":1.681434654,"42":43.88023034,"43":0.307324887,"44":0.014708442,"45":0.011001155,"46":0.007189255,"47":8.0,"48":4.0,"49":2.0,"50":1.0,"53":3.183734256,"56":0.067463973,"57":0.00209,"58":5.476340195,"60":13.78262971,"61":43.88023034,"62":0.014967554,"63":1.42E-4,"66":0.002894794,"67":0.033333459,"68":0.036228253,"70":0.001331605,"71":0.018666737,"72":0.019998342,"73":0.019998342,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":3.0,"42":9.9,"43":6.0},"appliedTotal":18.9,"externalId":"401127925","id":"01401127925","proTeamId":9,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"41":6.0,"42":99.0,"43":1.0,"45":1.0,"47":19.0,"48":9.0,"49":4.0,"50":3.0,"51":1.0,"53":6.0,"54":1.0,"58":10.0,"59":6.0,"60":16.5,"61":99.0,"155":1.0,"158":6.0,"210":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":10.021116761692307,"appliedStats":{"53":26.694728375,"72":-0.524254216,"24":1.8418519610000001,"25":0.527579634,"26":0.006231198,"42":74.1886564,"43":27.081298494000002,"44":0.447281512,"63":0.011144544000000001},"appliedTotal":130.27451790199999,"externalId":"2019","id":"122019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{"23":3.037283767,"24":18.41851961,"25":0.087929939,"26":0.003115599,"27":3.0,"28":1.0,"35":0.00558224,"36":0.003907568,"37":0.001018825,"38":3.47686E-5,"39":6.064141852,"40":1.416809201,"42":741.886564,"43":4.513549749,"44":0.223640756,"45":0.149187125,"46":0.097493786,"47":148.0,"48":74.0,"49":37.0,"50":29.0,"51":14.0,"53":53.38945675,"54":10.0,"55":5.0,"56":1.786707154,"57":0.0552589

his biggest enemy in recent seasons, and he played just two games in 2018. The departure of Tevin Coleman still doesn't completely clear him, because several young backs could steal work again. Still, Freeman is Atlanta's top back. Against a tough Vikings defense, he should be busy. Count him as a high-end fantasy RB2 in the 2019 opener.","2":"Freeman lost a fumble in a disappointing Week 1 effort, and Ito Smith continued to creep up on his workload. Atlanta was in comeback mode, so the run game took a backseat for most of the contest. He should be more involved against the Eagles, especially in the passing game, though he's squarely outside the fantasy RB1 tier -- and even his RB2 stock is dipping.","3":"Freeman slightly made up for another abysmal showing in Week 2 by doing more work as a receiver, but he's still losing momentum atop this backfield. Atlanta's play-calling in the first two games hasn't done him any favors, but neither does averaging 2.2 yards-per-carry. The Colts have been one of the friendliest fantasy defenses against the run so far (allowing 33.1 RB fantasy points-per-game) making Freeman a flex play for Week 3. It's dangerous for fantasy players to consider him as anything more than that, given  the presence of Ito Smith. ","4":"Freeman took advantage of a favorable matchup with a 95-yard day on offense in Week 3. He should continue to split work with Ito Smith, but this was a positive sign that Freeman's health isn't bothering him.

enters his sixth NFL season after missing all but 64 snaps due to injury last season. Of course, he posted stellar numbers in each of his previous three seasons. The 2014 fourth-round pick paced the position in fantasy points in 2015, finished sixth in 2016 and ranked ninth in the 13 weeks he was active and healthy in 2017. Freeman's efficiency has been good, but where he really stands out is volume near the goal line. He rushed for 29 touchdowns from 2015 to 2017, thanks to 41 carries inside the opponent's 5-yard line (second-most). He finished top-five in the category all three seasons and scored six touchdown receptions in that span. Tevin Coleman is gone, which helps solidify the 27-year-old's standing as a solid RB2 with RB1 upside.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":106.00453385399999,"appliedStats":{"53":21.05,"72":-2.612218498,"24":93.89,"25":51.599999999999994,"26":0.400105048,"42":36.089999999999996,"43":11.399999999999999,"44":0.126381158,"63":0.0648},"appliedTotal":212.00906770799998,"externalId":"2018","id":"102018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":223.2,"24":938.9,"25":8.6,"26":0.200052524,"27":187.0,"28":93.0,"29":46.0,"30":37.0,"31":18.0,"32":9.0,"33":44.0,"34":22.0,"35":0.46237882,"36":0.323665174,"37":2.420419897,"38":0.082599645,"39":4.206541218637993,"40":62.33251489,"41":42.1,"42":360.9,"43":1.9,"44":0.063190579,"45":0.086334851,"46":0.056419825,"47":72.0,"48":36.0,"49":18.0,"50":14.0,"51":7.0,"52":3.0,"53":42.1,"54":8.0,"55":4.0,"56":0.19074941,"57":0.0059,"58":53.3,"60":8.572446555819477,"61":23.96113379,"62":0.263243103,"63":0.0108,"66":2.308828314,"67":0.435800401,"68":2.7,"70":1.062061025,"71":0.244048224,"72":1.306109249,"73":1.306109249,"210":2.0}},{"appliedAverage":14.547841901866665,"appliedStats":{"53":24.61118108,"72":-2.205697794,"24":88.46279919,"25":48.073117518,"26":0.661006948,"42":42.07542764,"43":16.23659976,"44":0.248912336,"63":0.054281850000000006},"appliedTotal":218.21762852799998,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":208.7992485,"24":884.6279919,"25":8.012186253,"26":0.330503474,"27":176.0,"28":88.0,"29":44.0,"30":35.0,"31":17.0,"33":41.0,"34":20.0,"35":0.429258973,"36":0.300481281,"37":2.156574602,"38":0.073595617,"39":4.236739347,"40":58.73048909,"42":420.7542764,"43":2.70609996,"44":0.124456168,"45":0.08484149,"46":0.055443914,"47":84.0,"48":42.0,"49":21.0,"50":16.0,"51":8.0,"53":49.22236216,"54":9.0,"55":4.0,"56":0.2738634,"57":0.008470002,"58":62.4087926,"60":8.548030975,"61":27.93389387,"62":0.454959642,"63":0.009046975,"66":1.86287489,"67":0.43915437,"68":2.302029261,"70":0.85692245,"71":0.245926447,"72":1.102848897,"73":1.102848897,"210":15.0625}},{"appliedStats":{"53":1.302740382,"72":-0.140088214,"24":5.711766187,"25":2.388563838,"26":0.037913616,"42":2.215009067,"43":0.75221406,"44":0.010891102,"63":0.0034679999999999997},"appliedTotal":12.282478038000002,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":13.40544021,"24":57.11766187,"25":0.398093973,"26":0.018956808,"27":11.0,"28":5.0,"29":2.0,"30":2.0,"31":1.0,"33":2.0,"34":1.0,"35":0.027632493,"36":0.019342745,"37":0.142693284,"38":0.004869574,"39":4.260782263,"40":57.11766187,"42":22.15009067,"43":0.12536901,"44":0.005445551,"45":0.005931481,"46":0.003876223,"47":4.0,"48":2.0,"49":1.0,"53":2.605480764,"56":0.011412608,"57":3.53E-4,"58":3.195481532,"60":8.501344925,"61":22.15009067,"62":0.02440236,"63":5.78E-4,"66":0.123134648,"67":0.023932445,"68":0.147067093,"70":0.056641938,"71":0.013402169,"72":0.070044107,"73":0.070044107,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":1.31832324,"72":-0.136403512,"24":5.474145751,"25":2.4879542519999998,"26":0.035641438,"42":2.307727711,"43":0.682973088,"44":0.010374962,"63":0.003370512},"appliedTotal":12.184107442,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":12.74865769,"24":54.74145751,"25":0.414659042,"26":0.017820719,"27":10.0,"28":5.0,"29":2.0,"30":2.0,"31":1.0,"33":2.0,"34":1.0,"35":0.026136648,"36":0.018295654,"37":0.131050775,"38":0.00447226,"39":4.293899705,"40":54.74145751,"42":23.07727711,"43":0.113828848,"44":0.005187481,"45":0.006413235,"46":0.004191049,"47":4.0,"48":2.0,"49":1.0,"53":2.63664648,"56":0.012493081,"57":3.86384E-4,"58":3.270238287,"60":8.75251092,"61":23.07727711,"62":0.0230082,"63":5.61752E-4,"66":0.118443283,"67":0.024496153,"68":0.142939436,"70":0.05448391,"71":0.013717845,"72":0.068201756,"73":0.068201756,"210":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":12.217806101846152,"appliedStats":{"53":17.28643387,"72":-1.776838118,"24":71.654988,"25":31.329036564000003,"26":0.51364142,"42":29.261749440000003,"43":10.370565978,"44":0.147988908,"63":0.043913261999999995},"appliedTotal":158.831479324,"externalId":"2019","id":"122019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{"23":168.1733156,"24":716.54988,"25":5.221506094,"26":0.25682071,"27":143.0,"28":71.0,"29":35.0,"30":28.0,"31":14.0,"33":33.0,"34":16.0,"35":0.345439241,"36":0.241807469,"37":1.733080534,"38":0.059143389,"39":4.260782263,"40":55.11922154,"42":292.6174944,"43":1.728427663,"44":0.073994454,"45":0.075631543,"46":0.049425214,"47":58.0,"48":29.0,"49":14.0,"50":11.0,"51":5.0,"53":34.57286774,"54":6.0,"55":3.0,"56":0.154072429,"57":0.004765127,"58":42.40173635,"60":8.463790062,"61":22.50903803,"62":0.330815164,"63":0.007318877,"66":1.54474316,"67":0.317566439,"68":1.862309599,"70":0.710581854,"71":0.177837206,"72":0.888419059,"73":0.888419059,"210":13.0}

Seahawks' 2018 first-round pick (Rashaad Penny) and kept his spot as the lead back in the Seattle offense heading into the 2019 season. He carried a respectable workload as a runner and racked up 1,151 rushing yards and eight scores, but was limited in his duties as a pass catcher. Even still, against a Bengals defense that allowed the most points to running backs last year, he's locked in as an RB1 in Week 1. ","2":"Carson had a massive opening week, especially through the air. He saw a career-high seven targets, matching his career-best by hauling in six. He also scored touchdowns via both the air and the ground. Keep in mind that those stats did come against a Bengals team that allowed the most fantasy points to the RB position a year ago. Even still, it's a \"statement game\" to begin a season with that level of production. Carson's next opponent will be Pittsburgh, who allowed James White and Rex Burkhead to combine for 10 catches and 97 yards in Week 1. He's an easy pick as an RB2.","3":"Carson couldn't follow up on Week 1's 2-TD performance, failing to find the end zone against the Steelers and picking up only 87 yards from scrimmage on 18 touches. That said, the Oklahoma State product is still Seattle's lead back and one of the better options at the RB position in fantasy. In Week 3, he'll face the Saints, who haven't allowed a ton of production to opposing backs this season. As such, Carson isn't in a spot to break out by any means. Still, he's on the cusp of being an RB1 and more than good enough to start for any team in any format.","4":"Carson's 15 carries in Week 3 perfectly matched his totals from Weeks 1 and 2. It's been a humorously consistent workload for the Seahawks' starting back. However, one thing that has not remained consistent is his passing-game involvement. His seven targets in Week 1 now seem like an outlier, as he saw just three looks in Week 2 and only one in Week 3. He's also yet to break off a run of longer than 23 yards, averaging only 3.5 YPC. It's this lack of production, perhaps, that prompted Russell Wilson to run on his own more in Week 3. That's bad news, but the good news is that in Week 4 he faces an Arizona defense that was embarrassed by Christian McCaffrey in Week 3."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":21.095975232198143,"averageDraftPosition":50.7113685614269,"percentChange":-0.49304216166788706,"percentOwned":97.81428040491953,"percentStarted":83.12049759135823},"proTeamId":26,"rankings":{"0":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":17,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":12.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":12.833333333333334,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":11.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":11.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":10.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":10.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":33,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":33,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":33,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":14.0,"published":true,"ra

Seahawks drafted a running back (Rashaad Penny) in the first round of the 2018 draft, but that didn't stop second-year Carson from taking a firm grasp of lead back duties last season. Carson posted 247 carries (seventh-most) for 1,151 yards (fifth-most) and nine scores (seventh-most) in 14 games as the lead back in Seattle's run-heavy offense. Carson averaged 2.29 yards after contact (11th-best) and, though he played a minimal role as a receiver, caught all but three of his 23 targets. Seattle's run-heavy scheme will be back in 2019, and Carson's terrific second season gives him the leg up on Penny for the bulk of the backfield touches. Carson is expected to see a boost in receiving work, as well, so he'll touch the ball more than enough to allow RB2

round by the Seahawks in 2018, but draft status alone couldn't propel him to the top of the RB depth chart. Chris Carson carried the load as a runner, but Penny offered up a nice change of pace at times. He figures to do the same again in 2019. His value as a handcuff outweighs his Week 1 value, however, and he's no more than a flex option heading into a matchup with the Bengals, who struggled to stop the run a year ago.","2":"Penny was one of only two Seattle running backs to even see the field in Week 1, but he was clearly the second choice as Chris Carson had a huge game as the starter. Penny is a handcuff and high-value backup. Just don't start him in Week 2.","3":"Penny has seen a healthy workload through two weeks as Seattle's No. 2 running back. While he trails Chris Carson in snaps by over 40, he has had 16 carries plus  a target in the passing game when he's been on the field. That said, he's still not seeing enough volume to merit fantasy consideration, as only those in very deep leagues will have room for a player likely to see only seven carries-per-game with no involvement in the passing game. Keep him on the bench and wait to see if things change on the depth chart in Seattle.","4":"Penny missed out on Seattle's Week 3 loss, but could return for Week 4 against the Cardinals. That's a good time to return, as Arizona allowed Christian McCaffrey to run wild in Week 3. That said, Chris Carson is still Seattle's lead back and Russell Wilson took rushing matters more into his own hands in Week 3. The combination of Penny's injury status and the state of the Seahawks offense leave him as a risky flex option at best."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":1.2306501547987616,"averageDraftPosition":133.43261938494874,"percentChange":-5.9587325243591565,"percentOwned":62.27517070010182,"percentStarted":3.092608810190031},"proTeamId":26,"rankings":{"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":37,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":34,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":34,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":36,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":40,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":39,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":34,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":40,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":39,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":35.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":37.666666666666664,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":36,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":46,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":48,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":46.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":42,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":44,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":43,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":36,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":49.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":47.166666666666664,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":44,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":36,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":37,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":37,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":35,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":41,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":36,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":39.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":41.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":37,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}]},"seasonOutlook":"Penny was a surprise selection in the first round of the 2018 draft, and his rookie season was derailed by injuries and the emergence of Chris Carson. Penny appeared in 14 games and was on the field for 17 percent of Seattle's offensive snaps. The good news is that he was effective, racking up 419 yards on 85 carries (4.9 YPC) and 75 yards on 12 targets (6.3 YPT). The 23-year-old back has the size, talent and skill set to emerge into a three-down back, but he remains behind Carson on the depth chart.

ceiling over his seven-year NFL career, but his floor has been as steady as anyone at the QB position. He's averaged 20-plus fantasy points-per-game every year, and you can expect more of the same in 2019. The Bengals allowed the most passing yards-per-game in the NFL last season, rendering the decision quite easy for those with Wilson heading into Week 1. He's a starter in almost every kind of league.","2":"Wilson was efficient but not incredibly productive in Week 1, averaging 9.8 yards-per-attempt but only tossing 20 passes. He did score a pair of touchdowns and posted a solid fantasy score, but didn't add anything with his feet in the running game. He's a solid QB1 this week (and most weeks), especially against a Steelers defense that seems to be in transition, struggling in Week 1 against the Patriots. Still, you shouldn't be expecting huge numbers from Wilson every week.","3":"It's easy to look at passing statistics when considering how a quarterback will do against a defense, but don't forget to check the rushing stats, too. Both the Texans and Rams scored rushing touchdowns with their passers against the Saints this season. In 2018, five different quarterbacks ran for scores against New Orleans. Russell Wilson would have been a must-start against the Saints even without the added rushing upside. Added to the mix, he absolutely belongs in your lineup. His ceiling might not be all that high, but you can expect a solid return from the veteran signal-caller.","4":"Wilson registered his first rushing touchdown since 2017 in a Week 3 loss to New Orleans -- and then added another for good measure. In fact, he was two yards away from being Seattle's leading rusher against the Saints, all while throwing for 406 yards and a pair of touchdowns. It was a fantasy manager's dream, as rushing yards from a quarterback are like icing on a delicious cake. Whether it's by air or by land, expect more goodness from Wilson in Week 4 against the Cardinals, who have allowed the third-most QB fantasy points this season."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":2.4102167182662537,"averageDraftPosition":98.17287655247145,"percentChange":2.893043444381675,"percentOwned":95.4765322079647,"percentStarted":70.67464992895039},"proTeamId":26,"rankings":{"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":6.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":9.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":11.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":11.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":7.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":8.666666666666666,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":3.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":3.8333333333333335,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}]},"seasonOutlook":"Wilson paced all quarterbacks in fantasy scoring by 49 points in 2017, but Seattle's move to a run-heavy offense led to a dip all the way to ninth in 2018. Wilson posted eight top-10 outings (fifth most), but failed to clear 29 points in a single week. Wilson's 427 pass attempts ranked 20th and were his fewest since 2013. Wilson is a strong candidate for touchdown regression to the mean (his 8.2 percent TD rate ranks third over the past decade). Offensive line remains a concern after Wilson was sacked on 10.7 percent of his dropbacks (fifth highest).

slow opposing rushers last season, as tailbacks averaged 4.8 yards per carry against New England in 2018, the sixth-highest allowance in the league. With almost no competition for carries and what should still be a sizable portion of receiving usage despite the emergence of Jaylen Samuels, Conner is set to deliver RB1 results as a versatile bell cow against the Patriots in prime time.","2":"One the field for just 46% of the Steelers' offensive snaps, Conner has seemingly lost some offensive equity to Jaylen Samuels (33% snap rate). This doesn't mean Conner isn't still an awesome fantasy option, because he is, but rather he might not have the same dominant share of touches that helped fuel last season's breakout. The Seahawks have allowed 4.55 yards per rush to backs since the stat of last season (league average is 4.35 for this sample), evidence Conner can deliver value as a rushing force this week.","3":"ESPN's Jeremy Fowler reported Conner's knee injury is considered minor and shouldn't limit him from playing this week. Monitoring practice reports will prove important this week ahead of a meeting with an improved 49ers defense.

Conner was abruptly thrown into the fire last season with Le'Veon Bell sitting out the season. Conner picked up where his predecessor left off, handling 81 percent of the team's carries and 13 percent of the targets prior to suffering an injury in Week 13. During those 13 weeks, Conner put up 1,368 scrimmage yards and 13 touchdowns, which helped him to the fifth-most fantasy points among running backs. Conner's efficiency was solid and, unlike Bell, he benefited from getting many carries inside the opponent's 5-yard line (15, third-most). With Bell now in New York, the 24-year-old Conner returns as the Steelers' clear feature back. He's a back-end RB1.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":4.657440168076923,"appliedStats":{"53":3.616778055,"72":-0.791490294,"24":34.62319801,"25":15.446822958000002,"26":0.1966,"42":5.808224582,"43":1.602461178,"44":0.024207696,"63":0.01992},"appliedTotal":60.546722185,"externalId":"2018","id":"102018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":82.49407519,"24":346.2319801,"25":2.574470493,"26":0.0983,"27":69.0,"28":34.0,"29":17.0,"30":13.0,"31":6.0,"32":3.0,"33":16.0,"34":8.0,"35":0.165,"36":0.116,"37":0.647,"38":0.0221,"39":4.197052688966571,"40":22.98635552,"41":7.23355611,"42":58.08224582,"43":0.267076863,"44":0.012103848,"45":0.048203601,"46":0.031501053,"47":11.0,"48":5.0,"49":2.0,"50":2.0,"51":1.0,"53":7.23355611,"54":1.0,"56":0.024899923,"57":7.70101E-4,"58":9.537399151,"60":8.029556270352895,"61":3.85608271,"62":0.110419213,"63":0.00332,"66":0.777,"67":0.068161346,"68":0.845497853,"70":0.358,"71":0.038170354,"72":0.395745147,"73":0.395745147,"210":13.0}},{"appliedAverage":15.879289998666668,"appliedStats":{"53":24.95179634,"72":-3.16488602,"24":102.155251,"25":62.775807300000004,"26":0.872112278,"42":41.20871598,"43":9.149050008,"44":0.163503094,"63":0.078},"appliedTotal":238.18934998,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":233.9742499,"24":1021.55251,"25":10.46263455,"26":0.436056139,"27":204.0,"28":102.0,"29":51.0,"30":40.0,"31":20.0,"33":46.0,"34":23.0,"35":0.487632182,"36":0.341342527,"37":2.886944958,"38":0.0985,"39":4.366089477,"40":67.82091356,"42":412.0871598,"43":1.524841668,"44":0.081751547,"45":0.073020425,"46":0.047718848,"47":82.0,"48":41.0,"49":20.0,"50":16.0,"51":8.0,"53":49.90359268,"54":9.0,"55":4.0,"56":0.260170161,"57":0.00805,"58":63.26564758,"60":8.257665184,"61":27.35848364,"62":0.517807686,"63":0.013,"66":2.730984263,"67":0.582482587,"68":3.31346685,"70":1.256252761,"71":0.326190249,"72":1.58244301,"73":1.58244301,"210":15.0625}},{"appliedStats":{"53":2.0,"72":-2.0,"24":4.3,"42":1.4000000000000001},"appliedTotal":5.7,"externalId":"401127998","id":"01401127998","proTeamId":23,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":13.0,"24":43.0,"27":8.0,"28":4.0,"29":2.0,"30":1.0,"33":2.0,"34":1.0,"39":3.308,"40":43.0,"41":4.0,"42":14.0,"47":2.0,"48":1.0,"53":4.0,"58":4.0,"59":19.0,"60":3.5,"61":14.0,"66":1.0,"68":1.0,"70":1.0,"72":1.0,"73":1.0,"156":1.0,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":1.5760378065,"72":-0.202125084,"24":7.238219560000001,"25":3.528644268,"26":0.052601384,"42":2.565282175,"43":0.69051927,"44":0.01200627,"63":0.005004},"appliedTotal":15.466189649500002,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":16.26101835,"24":72.3821956,"25":0.588107378,"26":0.026300692,"27":14.0,"28":7.0,"29":3.0,"30":2.0,"31":1.0,"33":3.0,"34":1.0,"35":0.034306293,"36":0.024014405,"37":0.2292964,"38":0.007825006,"39":4.451270765,"40":72.3821956,"42":25.65282175,"43":0.115086545,"44":0.006003135,"45":0.003634417,"46":0.002375091,"47":5.0,"48":2.0,"49":1.0,"50":1.0,"53":3.152075613,"56":0.016007289,"57":4.95071E-4,"58":4.145194327,"60":8.13839035,"61":25.65282175,"62":0.032303827,"63":8.34E-4,"66":0.177754335,"67":0.034456336,"68":0.21221067,"70":0.081766994,"71":0.019295548,"72":0.101062542,"73":0.101062542,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":1.5073554855,"72":-0.16728925,"24":6.03833362,"25":2.845331028,"26":0.041847952,"42":2.387698695,"43":0.40921008000000003,"44":0.00735291,"63":0.004128},"appliedTotal":13.073968520500001,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":14.08133279,"24":60.3833362,"25":0.474221838,"26":0.020923976,"27":12.0,"28":6.0,"29":3.0,"30":2.0,"31":1.0,"33":2.0,"34":1.0,"35":0.029187139,"36":0.020430997,"37":0.159502107,"38":0.005443195,"39":4.288183306,"40":60.3833362,"42":23.87698695,"43":0.06820168,"44":0.003676455,"45":0.003503462,"46":0.002289512,"47":4.0,"48":2.0,"49":1.0,"53":3.014710971,"56":0.013501448,"57":4.18E-4,"58":3.892679184,"60":7.920157912,"61":23.87698695,"62":0.024600431,"63":6.88E-4,"66":0.144241747,"67":0.030881109,"68":0.175122856,"70":0.066351203,"71":0.017293421,"72":0.083644625,"73":0.083644625,"210":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":13.195426961461541,"appliedStats":{"53":20.133963445,"72":-2.375007562,"24":80.09745341000001,"25":34.907583066,"26":0.54241367,"42":31.5989846,"43":6.4635775859999995,"44":0.112966214,"63":0.058616070000000006},"appliedTotal":171.54055049900003,"externalId":"2019","id":"122019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{"23":187.1372888,"24":800.9745341,"25":5.817930511,"26":0.271206835,"27":160.0,"28":80.0,"29":40.0,"30":32.0,"31":16.0,"33":37.0,"34":18.0,"35":0.389436585,"36":0.272605609,"37":2.192158098,"38":0.074809945,"39"

Fantasy's No. 19 scoring receiver as a rookie in 2016, Hill climbed to eighth in 2017 and to first in 2018. Though Hill's usage has progressively increased, he has made his hay with outstanding efficiency. He paced all wide receivers with an 11.5 YPT in 2017 and finished fifth at 10.9 last season. He also has ranked top 12 in YPR and RAC both seasons, while actually reaching a career high 14.7 aDOT last season (eighth highest). The versatile Hill has ranked second among wideouts in carries during each of his three seasons and has added four rushing and five return touchdowns along the way.

one the league's most consistent receivers, starting off last season with an incredible run of eight consecutive 100-yard games. The 29-year-old had some soreness and injury concerns during the preseason, but assuming nothing alarming comes out about his status prior to kickoff, he should be set to lead Vikings receivers against the Falcons. Atlanta allowed the sixth-most fantasy points to wideouts last season, which means a healthy Thielen is a WR1 for Week 1.","2":"The Vikings hardly had to throw the ball at all on Sunday and, when they did, it went the way of their star wideouts and lead running back. Thielen combined with Stefon Diggs and Dalvin Cook to account for seven of the team's targets on Kirk Cousins' 10 attempts. He also hauled in a team-high three passes and caught a touchdown before Minnesota turned off the passing game in favor of a run-first approach in a game that quickly got out of hand. A matchup with the Packers is tougher from a personnel standpoint, but better from a competitiveness standpoint, so don't worry about Thielen at all this week. He's a borderline WR1.","3":"Minnesota pass-catchers have seen only 42 targets over two weeks -- and 20 of those have gone to Thielen and fellow wideout Stefon Diggs. When the Vikings do air it out, those are clearly their preferred options, with Thielen seeing a slight edge in volume so far. The Vikings are certainly a run-first team this year, but they will pass it enough to sustain the fantasy value of their receivers. The Raiders allowed a big day to the Chiefs in Week 2 (to no one's surprise), but also let Emmanuel Sanders post decent numbers in Week 1. That bodes well enough for Thielen that he can be locked in as a WR2 for Week 3.","4":"The Vikings don't take to the air often, but when they do, it seems to go to Thielen more often than not. He has seen 16 targets (most on the Vikings), and has reeled in two of the three receiving touchdowns the team has scored. A Week 4 matchup with the Bears will be difficult, as Chicago has one of the more talented defenses in the league, but Emmanuel Sanders found paydirt against them, as did Washington's Paul Richardson and Terry McLaurin. Trust Thielen as a WR2, despite the difficult opponent."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":24.10061919504644,"averageDraftPosition":33.66486126156153,"percentChange":-0.04028881377061566,"percentOwned":99.42833870771369,"percentStarted":86.85591985207579},"proTeamId":16,"rankings":{"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":11.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":11.833333333333334,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":10.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":10.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":9.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":8.833333333333334,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":17,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":43,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":23,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":43,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":43,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":19.0,"published":true,

did it again. For the fourth consecutive season, he posted a career high in receptions (113), receiving yards (1,373) and fantasy points (307). Thielen also scored a career-high nine touchdowns, which nearly matched his previous career total of 10. Thielen posted eight top 10 fantasy weeks, which tied for most in the league, though he ended up seventh in fantasy points at season's end after Minnesota switched offensive coordinators and to a run-heavy offense down the stretch. Thielen has never cleared 10 end zone targets in a season, and Mike Zimmer's commitment to establishing the run could limit his upside a bit, but the 28-year-old has proven to be one of the best in the business.

has racked up more receiving yards than Kittle did last season in what was the definition of a breakout campaign for the 2017 draftee. He hasn't proven to be a go-to guy in the red zone yet, and he saw only seven end-zone targets last season, but don't let that dissuade you. Against a Buccaneers side that allowed the third-most passing touchdowns a season ago, Kittle is a must-start tight end in all formats.","2":"Week 1 was more of the same for Kittle, who saw a team-high 10 targets (no one elese had more than three) and racked up 54 yards. He even found the end zone on a play that was called back due to a penalty. He's a high-volume tight end in a pretty tame offense, so he's got a high floor every week, especially in PPR leagues. The Bengals were one of the weaker teams at defending tight ends a year ago, so Kittle is locked in as a TE1 this week.","3":"Kittle leads all 49ers pass-catchers in targets through two weeks. While he doesn't yet have any official touchdowns, he has found the end zone on more than one occasion this season only to see a yellow flag negate his efforts. He did see a surprising dip in volume in Week 2, but some variance is to be expected in an offense led by a somewhat inconsistent passer. He's still an elite tight end from a fantasy perspective and is a must-start against a Steelers defense that allowed Will Dissly to score twice in Week 2."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":23.024767801857585,"averageDraftPosition":33.512920973657884,"percentChange":-0.9718570016830768,"percentOwned":98.73637366940795,"percentStarted":28.876001281640498},"proTeamId":25,"rankings":{"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":2.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":2.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6}],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":2.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":2.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":2.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":2.1666666666666665,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6}]},"seasonOutlook":"After showing flashes of his massive ceiling as a fifth-round rookie in 2017, Kittle exploded for a tight-end record 1,377 receiving yards last season. The Iowa product also ranked first at the position RAC (9.7) and was third in targets (136), receptions (88), fantasy points (259) and YPR (15.6). The only area where Kittle was truly underwhelming was in the scoring department, as he managed only five touchdowns (5.8 OTD) and seven end-zone targets.

contributor since making his debut for the Rams in 2017 after being selected in the third round of the NFL Draft. The Eastern Washignton product was holding his own among a crowded WR picture in 2018 before injuries cut his season short. He figures to handle a healthy workload in 2019 in a fantasy-friendly offense. The Panthers allowed the eight-most fantasy points to wideouts a year ago, so this is a great spot for Kupp to get back into a rhythm, assuming he's cleared to play and featured in the starting lineup.","2":"Welcome back, Cooper! Mr. Kupp hadn't played since November of last year, but stepped right back in and played his part in the Rams offense, seeing only a few snaps from the sideline. He finished second on the team in targets and, while he didn't rack up a ton of yards this time around, the yards will come -- especially on days when the Rams are working at a slightly higher level than they were in a bit of a slow Week 1 performance. He's definitely a WR2 for this week's contest against the Saints. ","3":"Of the Rams' three elite wideouts, it's Kupp who has led the way so far this season, ranking first in catches, targets and yards. He's not yet found the end zone, but that's certain to come soon as this Jared Goff-led team gets into more back-and-forth offensive contests later this year. That kind of affair certainly could come in Week 3, as the Browns appear to be capable with the ball, but shaky without it. In Week 1, they allowed Marcus Mariota to throw for three scores. While Luke Falk and the Jets couldn't find paydirt in Week 2, they're a far cry from the Rams' prolific offense. Kupp is a borderline WR1 for Week 3.","4":"Jared Goff may have three great receivers in his huddle, but Kupp has stood out above the others so far this season in terms of the numbers we care about in fantasy. The Eastern Washington product has the most targets and touchdowns of the WR trio, and has also seen the most red-zone looks. In Week 4, Kupp and the Rams host the Buccaneers, who allowed Sterling Shepard to go for 100 yards and a score in Week 3. They are not a defense to be feared. Start Kupp as a WR1 with confidence."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":15.219814241486068,"averageDraftPosition":54.64133966508373,"percentChange":1.3509988324427695,"percentOwned":98.16599918121786,"percentStarted":83.59758637261707},"proTeamId":14,"rankings":{"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":26,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":26,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":27,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":27,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":22,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":26.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":21.833333333333332,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":17,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":18.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":17.833333333333332,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":17,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":17,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":15.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":13.333333333333334,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":5.

has been a solid fantasy asset since being selected in the third round of the 2017 draft, but a pair of injuries derailed what would've been a major breakout in 2018. During the seven full games he played with Brandin Cooks and Robert Woods last season, Kupp handled a solid 22 percent target share (7.3 per game) and ranked eighth in fantasy points. Kupp scored six touchdowns during those seven games (though his 2.7 OTD suggests he was over his head in that department).

White; he's going to net tons of targets out of the backfield in the Patriots' quick-hitting passing attack. Success around the red zone is gravy for White, who has a penchant for big plays in high-leverage moments. Given the expectedly high score in this meeting with the Steelers, White is a solid RB2 option in PPR formats.","2":"With 82 scrimmage yards thanks to valuable receiving duties, White's Week 1 confirmed his high-floor persists. The Dolphins were badly gashed by the Ravens' backfield last week, with White and his backfield peers poised for strong fantasy results in South Beach.","3":"It's becoming clear White won't approach the amazing 120 targets he netted last season for a Patriots team that was missing several playmakers in the passing phase. Now flush with receiving depth, including fellow back Rex Burkhead, the Patriots don’t need to feed White all those receptions. This clearly hurts his stock heading into this matchup with a Jets front missing its best playmaker in C.J. Mosley, but he remains in the flex tier in PPR formats if for his unique red zone efficiency.","4":"White missed last week's win over the Jets due to the birth of his child. We all wish White's sleeping pattern some luck. Upon returning to the lineup this week we can expect White to resume his target-rich role out of the backfield, albeit with more competition from Rex Burkhead. The Bills present a matchup challenge, but White's consistent receiving share should support a solid flex performance."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":6.43343653250774,"averageDraftPosition":90.43167805365772,"percentChange":-2.088184691574085,"percentOwned":92.22982714832834,"percentStarted":43.644317297484726},"proTeamId":17,"rankings":{"0":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":26,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2}],"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":20,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":20,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":20,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":22,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":20,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":32,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":21,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":24.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":19.333333333333332,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":26,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":24,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":24,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":22,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":29,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":22,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":23,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":26.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":23.333333333333332,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":27,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":21,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":46.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":20,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":21,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":20,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":20,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":54,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":29,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":21,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":54,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":54,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":24.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":20.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":73,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":54,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":23,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}]},"seasonOutlook":"White took his game to another level in 2018 and has cemented himself as one of the game's best receiving backs. In fact, the past four seasons, White ranks first at the position in targets (328), second in receptions (243), second in receiving yards (2141) and easily first in receiving touchdowns (19). He posted career-high marks in each of those categories in 2018, as well as carries (94) and yards per carry (4.5). White was fantasy's No. 6 scoring back through Week 9 last season, but his usage dropped when Sony Michel and Rex Burkhead were active, and he ranked 27th from Week 10 on. A similar backfield share is expected in 2019, which positions White more as a fringe RB2 than a likely repeat RB1.

last season's brilliant yardage and scoring efficiency? The Raiders might not be the right team to ask; Lindsay burned Oakland for 6.4 yards per carry in two meetings last season. Lindsay is in the RB2 mix for this division meeting on Monday evening, as he's due roughly half of the total work out of the backfield against last season's league-worst defense.","2":"Lindsay's 66 scrimmage yards on 15 touches for the Broncos in Week 1 is likely the usage recipe we can expect for him going forward. Receiving usage could help Lindsay produce in an otherwise difficult setup facing a stingy Chicago front seven. With a tough opponent and a seemingly firm usage ceiling, Lindsay enters Week 2 as a low-end flex.","3":"Denver wants to split work between Lindsay and Royce Freeman as evenly as possible. Lindsay netted 17 touches while running 23 routes to Freeman's 16 and 21 in the loss to the Bears in Week 2. Without the clear majority share of valuable receiving duties, Lindsay is a flex option against a Packers front that has allowed the second-most yards per carry (6.1) to backs this season.","4":"Lindsay thrived as a rusher and receiver in the Broncos' Week 3 loss to the Packers. Even while Royce Freeman is matching Lindsay in nearly every usage indicator, Lindsay is the stronger receiving option and a solid RB2 in a meeting with a respectable Jacksonville defense."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":5.405572755417957,"averageDraftPosition":88.61921826818902,"percentChange":2.2886204616901438,"percentOwned":95.48544881721578,"percentStarted":67.17958028514978},"proTeamId":7,"rankings":{"0":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":33,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":22,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":22,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":22,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":21,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":23,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":23,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":21,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":26,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":23,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":21.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":23.166666666666668,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":21,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":22,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":32,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":22,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":29,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":35,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":31,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":31,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":27,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":30,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":27.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":29.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":26,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":20,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":22,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":20,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":24,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":24,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":23,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":29,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":32,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":23.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":25.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":17,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":24,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":17,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":24,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":24,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":16.0,"published":tr

entered the 2018 season as a notable combine snub who signed on with Denver as an undrafted free agent. It didn't take him long to become one of the league's most explosive playmakers. Lindsay averaged 5.4 YPC (sixth-highest) on 192 attempts and finished 13th among backs in fantasy points. Although Lindsay's explosiveness can't be overlooked, there were some red flags. He benefited from 3.82 yards before contact per attempt (second-highest), averaged 1.58 after contact (14th-worst), averaged 5.0 yards per target (sixth-worst) and saw his YPC plummet to 2.6 in his final three games. It's possible that we've already seen Lindsay's ceiling, as he turns 25 years old this summer, but he is set for a significant role along with fellow second-year back Royce Freeman this season. Lindsay figures to return to earth a bit, but he's still in the RB2

with a rivalry matchup against the Packers. Don't let a game against Green Bay scare you away, though. Since defense and special teams scoring is driven by splash plays, consider that the Bears led the NFL in interceptions and ranked No. 3 in sacks last season, fueling their fantasy point total. They're an easy pick to start this and every week of the 2019 season.","2":"In what turned out to be a bit of an ugly opening game to the 2019 NFL season, the Bears limited the Packers to only 10 points while picking up five sacks to start the season off on the right foot for those who invested in this premium D/ST unit. This week, the Bears take on a Denver team that stumbled to a loss in a primetime matchup with the divisional-rival Raiders. This is another great spot to start what is arguably the top D/ST in fantasy fotoball. ","3":"The Bears have an elite defensive unit, but that hasn't translated to fantasy success quite yet in 2019. The seven sacks are nice, but with only one turnover forced, they're not making the splash plays we want to see from a high-end D/ST. Washington might not have an offense loaded with stars, but they've been protecting the quarterback and taking care of the ball through two weeks, so we could be in for another lackluster performance from the Bears D/ST. That said, they're still a must-start as one of the most talent-laden defenses in football."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":2.989113530326594,"averageDraftPosition":60.76818979199733,"percentChange":0.28267818323379856,"percentOwned":98.91292285830815,"percentStarted":89.99904882551569},"proTeamId":3,"rankings":{"1":[],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":2.1666666666666665,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":2.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":2.6666666666666665,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":3.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":8.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":9.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16}]},"seasonOutlook":"The Bears entered the 2018 season with arguably the league's best defense on paper, and boy, did they deliver. Fantasy's top-scoring D/ST (55 points more than second place) paced the NFL in interceptions (27), D/ST touchdowns (six), passes defensed (92) and points allowed (283). They ranked third in sacks with 50. Chicago lost Adrian Amos and Bryce Callahan in free agency but remains stocked with star talent on every level, led by the likes of Akiem Hicks, Khalil Mack, Kyle Fuller, Danny Trevathan and Eddie Jackson. The addition of star returner Cordarrelle Patterson (league-high four kick return touchdowns since 2014) adds to the appeal.

option.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":8.434964852999999,"appliedStats":{"80":53.5750074,"85":-5.174234800000001,"86":35.93256028,"74":16.860593719999997,"77":33.765511048},"appliedTotal":134.95943764799998,"externalId":"2018","id":"102018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"74":3.372118744,"75":5.275694559,"76":1.903575815,"77":8.441377762,"78":10.57578136,"79":2.1344035980000005,"80":17.8583358,"81":18.99459118,"82":1.1362553800000015,"83":29.6718323,"84":34.8460671,"85":5.174234800000001,"86":35.93256028,"87":38.0166298,"88":2.08406952,"210":16.0}},{"appliedStats":{"80":3.0,"86":3.0,"77":4.0},"appliedTotal":10.0,"externalId":"401127953","id":"01401127953","proTeamId":12,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"77":1.0,"78":1.0,"80":1.0,"81":1.0,"83":2.0,"84":2.0,"86":3.0,"87":4.0,"88":1.0,"155":1.0,"158":9.0,"210":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":8.65453933125,"appliedStats":{"80":47.25529494,"85":-4.198755465,"86":50.51008007,"74":15.155425295,"77":29.75058446},"appliedTotal":138.4726293,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"74":3.031085059,"75":4.651103573,"76":1.620018514,"77":7.437646115,"78":9.28091367,"79":1.843267555,"80":15.75176498,"81":16.48723438,"82":0.735469396,"83":26.22049616,"84":30.41925162,"85":4.198755465,"86":50.51008007,"87":52.75250548,"88":2.242425403,"198":3.031085059,"199":4.651103573,"200":1.620018514,"210":16.0}},{"appliedStats":{"80":2.799867465,"85":-0.273587312,"86":3.413110756,"74":0.89268756,"77":1.758451856},"appliedTotal":8.590530325,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"74":0.178537512,"75":0.279046619,"76":0.100509108,"77":0.439612964,"78":0.55681572,"79":0.117202756,"80":0.933289155,"81":0.989164603,"82":0.055875448,"83":1.55143963,"84":1.825026942,"85":0.273587312,"86":3.413110756,"87":3.609418025,"88":0.196307269,"198":0.178537512,"199":0.279046619,"200":0.100509108}},{"appliedStats":{"80":2.939751168,"85":-0.261204513,"86":3.288668415,"74":0.942818775,"77":1.8507834},"appliedTotal":8.760817245,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"74":0.188563755,"75":0.289345081,"76":0.100781327,"77":0.46269585,"78":0.577365496,"79":0.114669646,"80":0.979917056,"81":1.025670596,"82":0.04575354,"83":1.63117666,"84":1.892381173,"85":0.261204513,"86":3.288668415,"87":3.434670829,"88":0.146002414,"198":0.188563755,"199":0.289345081,"200":0.100781327}},{"appliedAverage":8.466078025076923,"appliedStats":{"80":36.18996621,"85":-3.536280093,"86":43.13776124,"74":11.538522085,"77":22.729044884},"appliedTotal":110.059014326,"externalId":"2019","id":"122019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{"74":2.307704417,"75":3.606844917,"76":1.299140499,"77":5.682261221,"78":7.197177136,"79":1.514915914,"80":12.06332207,"81":12.78554575,"82":0.722223679,"83":20.05328771,"84":23.5895678,"85":3.536280093,"86":43.13776124,"87":45.61885744,"88":2.481096192,"198":2.307704417,"199":3.606844917,"200":1.299140499,"210":13.0}},{"appliedStats":{"80":3.0,"85":-1.0,"86":4.0,"77":4.0},"appliedTotal":10.0,"externalId":"401128023","id":"01401128023","proTeamId":12,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"80":1.0,"81":2.0,"82":1.0,"83":2.0,"84":3.0,"85":1.0,"86":4.0,"87":4.0,"155":1.0,"77":1.0,"78":1.0,"158":10.0}},{"appliedAverage":9.0,"appliedStats":{"80":48.0,"85":-3.0,"86":65.0,"74":10.0,"77":24.0},"appliedTotal":144.0,"externalId":"2018","id":"002018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"74":2.0,"75":4.0,"76":2.0,"77":6.0,"78":7.0,"79":1.0,"80":16.0,"81":16.0,"83":24.0,"84":27.0,"85":3.0,"86":65.0,"87":69.0,"88":4.0,"107":1.0,"108":1.0,"109":2.0,"155":12.0,"156":4.0,"174":0.75,"210":16.0}},{"appliedAverage":10.333333333333334,"appliedStats":{"80":12.0,"86":11.0,"77":8.0},"appliedTotal":31.0,"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"80":4.0,"81":4.0,"210":3.0,"83":6.0,"84":6.0,"86":11.0,"87":12.0,"88":1.0,"155":3.0,"77":2.0,"78":2.0,"158":29.0}}],"universeId":1},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":4,"totalRanking":112,"totalRating":31.0}},"rosterLocked":true,"status":"ONTEAM","tradeLocked":false},"status":"NORMAL"},{"acquisitionDate":1567089943293,"acquisitionType":"ADD","injuryStatus":"NORMAL","lineupSlotId":6,"pendingTransactionIds":null,"playerId":2576925,"playerPoolEntry":{"appliedStatTotal":29.400000000000002,"id":2576925,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":true,"onTeamId":5,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":4,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":1,"publ

of redemption and recovery and should serve as the team's top receiving threat from the tight end position. It's not year clear if Waller can mimic or even approach the usage and production Jared Cook posted last year with Oakland, but this is at least an encouraging opening matchup -- Denver allowed the seventh-most yards to tight ends in 2018 -- for those considering streaming Waller.","2":"Waller impressively played on all of Oakland's 55 offensive snaps in Week 1 and earned a robust 31% target share. For some context, Waller had seven catches on Monday against Denver and had six catches all of last season. The Chiefs have allowed 1,098 yards to tight ends since the start of last season, sixth most in the league and a strong indicator Waller could thrive as a top target fo Derek Carr this Sunday.","3":"Another solid showing for this former college wideout in Week 2 included catching all but one of his seven targets while tallying a team-high 54 yards after the catch in the loss to the Chiefs. The Vikings have ceded the seventh-fewest yards to tight ends dating back to Week 1 of last year, but Waller's stellar usage pattern thus far supports TE1 expectations yet again.","4":"From college wideout to standout NFL tight end, Waller is somehow on pace for over 130 receptions.

work—especially at the goal line—will be divvied between Hyde and Duke Johnson, but it's safe to assume Hyde won't see much passing work in this one. The Saints allowed the fewest rushing yards to tailbacks last season, more evidence Hyde should ride the fantasy pine.","2":"On the field for 37% of Houston's offensive snaps in the opener, Hyde spent just seven of those plays as a receiving threat. The Jaguars have allowed the ninth-fewest yards per carry to tailbacks since the start of last season, adding another reason to fade Hyde.","3":"Tons of work on the ground fostered some fantasy value for the Texans' Hyde in a Week 2, when he had 20 carries for 90 yards, his most in a game since Week 3 last season with the Browns. The Chargers have been solid against the run since the start of last season (allowing 91.2 rushing yards to backfields during that span), leaving Hyde outside of the flex tier this week.","4":"Held to just 1.9 yards per carry and without any targets, Hyde's fantasy stock plummeted after Week 3. The Panthers are allowing 4.4 yards per carry to opposing backs, but starting Hyde is a bet that he both capitalizes on the matchup and nets a good deal of touches."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":0.2089783281733746,"averageDraftPosition":163.64014330944843,"percentChange":4.5267080758835405,"percentOwned":56.71312151214865,"percentStarted":17.894679883063088},"proTeamId":34,"rankings":{"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":50,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":50.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":42,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":47,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":42,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":48,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":48,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":50,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":49,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":49,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":41,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":44.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":46.166666666666664,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":38,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":37,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":36,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":37,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":37,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":35,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":40,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":29,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":37,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":28,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":34.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":35.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":36,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":30,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":30,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":30,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":34,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":28,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":36,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":24,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":27,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":24,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":29.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":29.166666666666668,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":43,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":28,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}]},"seasonOutlook":"Hyde is now with Houston after a disappointing 2018 campaign in which he managed only 571 yards on 172 carries (3.3 YPC) and 33 yards on 10 catches (2.1 YPT) in 14 games with Cleveland and Jacksonville. Although the 27-year-old's efficiency has dipped after an explosive start to his career, Hyde has often ranked near the top of the league in stacked boxes (76th percentile or higher in average box defenders in four of his five seasons) and quietly posted a solid 1.9 YAC last season. Hyde has a path to consistent carries with only Duke Johnson Jr. in his way in Houston and, though he isn't an effective receiver, flex value is within range if he locks down 13-to-15 carries per game. He's worth a late-round flier.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":9.825556558642857,"appliedStats":{"53":7.756828215,"72":-1.883020444,"24":77.73261103,"25":38.653405752,"26":0.309720994,"42":11.11456784,"43":3.77906601,"44":0.047111894,"63":0.04750053},"appliedTotal":137.557791821,"externalId":"2018","id":"102018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":194.6898114,"24":777.3261103,"25":6.442234292,"26":0.154860497,"27":155.0,"28":77.0,"29":38.0,"30":31.0,"31":15.0,"32":7.0,"33":38.0,"34":19.0,"35":0.397729394,"36":0.278410575,"37":1.676557188,"38":0.057214465,"39":3.992638878790346,"40":51.60671271,"41":15.51365643,"42":111.1456784,"43":0.629844335,"44":0.023555947,"45":0.03537385,"46":0.023116811,"47":22.0,"48":11.0,"49":5.0,"50":4.0,"51":2.0,"52":1.0,"53":15.51365643,"54":3.0,"55":1.0,"56":0.046023047,"57":0.001423393,"58":20.89652536,"60":7.1643766833116596,"61":7.378966198,"62":0.178416443,"63":0.007916755,"66":1.86576946,"67":0.148671911,"68":2.014441371,"70":0.858253952,"71":0.08325627,"72":0.941510222,"73":0.941510222,"210":14.0}},{"appliedAverage":5.703581867466667,"appliedStats":{"53":3.853672097,"72":-1.396027184,"24":52.49619944,"25":23.641147218,"26":0.2451882,"42":4.808327429,"43":1.847353842,"44":0.022496982,"63":0.035369988000000005},"appliedTotal":85.55372801200001,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":136.5560722,"24":524.9619944,"25":3.940191203,"26":0.1225941,"27":104.0,"28":52.0,"29":26.0,"30":20.0,"31":10.0,"33":27.0,"34":13.0,"35":0.270466272,"36":0.18932639,"37":0.766183021,"38":0.026146887,"39":3.844296236,"40":34.85224859,"42":48.08327429,"43":0.307892307,"44":0.011248491,"45":0.032179563,"46":0.021029345,"47":9.0,"48":4.0,"49":2.0,"50":1.0,"53":7.707344194,"54":1.0,"56":0.024319737,"57":7.52157E-4,"58":10.29668895,"60":6.238630724,"61":3.192250575,"62":0.13384259,"63":0.005894998,"66":1.419861287,"67":0.080138213,"68":1.499999501,"70":0.653136192,"71":0.044877399,"72":0.698013592,"73":0.698013592,"210":15.0625}},{"appliedStats":{"53":0.2339734205,"72":-0.162532432,"24":6.807763994,"25":2.88273276,"26":0.028878866,"42":0.2940804892,"43":0.142489956,"44":0.00174394,"63":0.00414},"appliedTotal":10.233270993700001,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":16.26263076,"24":68.07763994,"25":0.48045546,"26":0.014439433,"27":13.0,"28":6.0,"29":3.0,"30":2.0,"31":1.0,"33":3.0,"34":1.0,"35":0.03431014,"36":0.024017098,"37":0.202804974,"38":0.006920956,"39":4.186139436,"40":68.07763994,"42":2.940804892,"43":0.023748326,"44":8.7197E-4,"45":0.001937978,"46":0.001266469,"53":0.467946841,"56":0.00149442,"57":4.62192E-5,"58":0.61858112,"60":6.284484982,"61":2.940804892,"62":0.015311403,"63":6.9E-4,"66":0.170686594,"67":0.004911398,"68":0.175597992,"70":0.078515833,"71":0.002750383,"72":0.081266216,"73":0.081266216,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":0.249456079,"72":-0.135964658,"24":5.577117688,"25":1.694020632,"26":0.018464606,"42":0.3200195136,"43":0.110700498,"44":0.001342532,"63":0.0034577939999999997},"appliedTotal":7.8386146846,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":13.37192533,"24":55.77117688,"25":0.282336772,"26":0.009232303,"27":11.0,"28":5.0,"29":2.0,"30":2.0,"31":1.0,"33":2.0,"34":1.0,"35":0.027555807,"36":0.019289065,"37":0.13603519,"38":0.004642359,"39":4.170766399,"40":55.77117688,"42":3.200195136,"43":0.018450083,"44":6.71266E-4,"45":0.001936429,"46":0.001265457,"53":0.498912158,"56":0.001601204,"57":4.95218E-5,"58":0.666282663,"60":6.414345855,"61":3.200195136,"62":0.009903569,"63":5.76299E-4,"66":0.141366605,"67":0.005274447,"68":0.146641052,"70":0.065028638,"71":0.002953691,"72":0.067982329,"73":0.067982329,"210":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":9.496712075153848,"appliedStats":{"53":3.162973182,"72":-2.014607098,"24":83.82728583000001,"25":32.35494921,"26":0.334236742,"42":4.040522847,"43":1.680148086,"44":0.020453266,"63":0.051294912000000005},"appliedTotal":123.45725697700003,"externalId":"2019","id":"122019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{"23":200.9370936,"24":838.2728583,"25":5.392491535,"26":0.167118371,"27":167.0,"28":83.0,"29":41.0,"30":33.0,"31":16.0,"33":40.0,"34":20.0,"35":0.421449305,"36":0.295014513,"37":2.378827764,"38":0.081180265,"39":4.171817376,"40":64.48252756,"42":40.40522847,"43":0.280024681,"44":0.010226633,"45":0.025244818,"46":0.016497489,"47":8.0,"48":4.0,"49":2.0,"50":1.0,"53":6.325946364,"54":1.0,"56":0.020323164,"57":6.28551E-4,"58":8.362290014,"60":6.387222739,"61":3.108094497,"62":0.177345005,"63":0.008549152,"66":2.108961862,"67":0.066394807,"68":2.175356669,"70":0.970122456,"71":0.037181092,"72":1.007303549,"73":1.007303549,"210":13.0}},{"appliedStats":{"24":1.9000000000000001,"

favorite to occupy a starting spot on the outside after Josh Doctson's release. The rookie is an intriguing bench player, but should stay there for Week 1 against the Eagles. ","2":"McLaurin averaged a ridiculous 17.9 yards-per-target in Week 1, catching five balls for 125 yards and his first NFL touchdown. The rookie out of Ohio State has shot into an immediate path for frequent work on a club thirsty for wideout consistency, and his role as a deep-play asset makes him a weekly \"all or nothing\" dart throw in many fantasy leagues. Rank him as a WR3/flex against the Cowboys in Week 2.","3":"McLaurin followed up his electric NFL debut by scoring for the second straight game in Week 2. A tough Bears matchup awaits in Week 3, which likely lowers his ceiling. Still, the big-play rookie adds a much-needed dimension to Washington's offense, and his prowess with the deep ball has the upside to pay off -- even in tough draws. That gives him some WR3 appeal this weekend, but more safely pegs him as a flex starter.","4":"McLaurin has been one of fantasy's best rookies so far in 2019. In each of his first three outings, he's scored once, seen seven-plus targets and caught at least five passes. He'll square off with Giants CB Janoris Jenkins in Week 4, but the aging defensive back has been burned a bit more than usual this season. The Giants, in fact, have allowed the second-most WR fantasy points-per-game this year. McLaurin is a strong fantasy WR3, with his downfield prowess keeping his ceiling high, even if Washington switches quarterbacks from Case Keenum to rookie Dwayne Haskins."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":0.8746130030959752,"averageDraftPosition":146.06532244625896,"percentChange":17.826060359217273,"percentOwned":80.67626487290042,"percentStarted":53.19941789931139},"proTeamId":28,"rankings":{"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":46,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":41,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":40,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":41,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":47,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":31,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":42,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":41,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":26,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":46.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":37.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":35,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":36,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":38,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":36,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":42,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":36,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":41,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":36,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":37,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":40,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":37.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":38.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":27,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":24,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":49,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":17,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":29,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":49,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":31,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":49,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":31.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":37.833333333333336,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":48,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":49,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23}]},"seasonOutlook":"The Redskins drafted McLaurin in the third round of April's draft, adding the Ohio State product to a wide receiver room that also includes Paul Richardson, Kelvin Harmon and Trey Quinn. McLaurin is an older prospect (he turned 23 in April) with an average frame (6-foot, 208 pounds) who is extremely fast (4.35 40-yard dash). An efficient receiver, the former Buckeye averaged 14.3 yards per target last season, which topped this class. McLaurin could settle in as a depth receiver and special-teams standout, but he has a terrific opportunity for a major rookie-season role because of Washington's shaky depth chart. That puts him on the late-round radar in deeper leagues.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":6.2841633368125,"appliedStats":{"53":23.069973565,"72":-0.541051606,"42":61.51350585,"43":16.206228726,"44":0.286565788,"63":0.011391066},"appliedTotal":100.546613389,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"42":615.1350585,"43":2.701038121,"44":0.143282894,"45":0.168715454,"46":0.110255549,"47":123.0,"48":61.0,"49":30.0,"50":24.0,"51":12.0,"53":46.13994713,"54":9.0,"55":4.0,"56":0.751190866,"57":0.023232707,"58":77.72367034,"60":13.33194112,"61":38.44594116,"62":0.143282894,"63":0.001898511,"67":0.483081791,"68":0.483081791,"71":0.270525803,"72":0.270525803,"73":0.270525803,"210":16.0}},{"appliedStats":{},"appliedTotal":0.0,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{}},{"appliedStats":{"53":2.196696975,"72":-0.051518326,"42":5.84412884,"43":1.6023882239999998,"44":0.025901314,"63":0.0010860000000000002},"appliedTotal":9.618683027,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"42":58.4412884,"43":0.267064704,"44":0.012950657,"45":0.010871487,"46":0.007104517,"47":11.0,"48":5.0,"49":2.0,"50":2.0,"51":1.0,"53":4.39339395,"56":0.145265361,"57":0.004492743,"58":7.314663172,"60":13.30208241,"61":58.4412884,"62":0.012950657,"63":1.81E-4,"67":0.045998506,"68":0.045998506,"71":0.025759163,"72":0.025759163,"73":0.025759163,"210":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":10.2934732735,"appliedStats":{"53":25.56585731,"72":-0.599586648,"42":72.02549364000001,"43":26.109933612,"44":0.407357926,"63":0.012623441999999999},"appliedTotal":123.52167928200001,"externalId":"2019","id":"122019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{"42":720.2549364,"43":4.351655602,"44":0.203678963,"45":0.153146703,"46":0.100081371,"47":144.0,"48":72.0,"49":36.0,"50":28.0,"51":14.0,"53":51.13171462,"54":10.0,"55":5.0,"56":1.867544307,"57":0.057759102,"58":86.79767604,"60":14.08626606,"61":60.0212447,"62":0.203678963,"63":0.002103907,"67":0.535345222,"68":0.535345222,"71":0.299793324,"72":0.299793324,"73":0.299793324,"210":12.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":3.0,"42":7.0,"43":6.0},"appliedTotal":16.0,"externalId":"401128003","id":"01401128003","proTeamId":28,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"41":6.0,"42":70.0,"43":1.0,"47":14.0,"48":7.0,"49":3.0,"50":2.0,"51":1.0,"53":6.0,"54":1.0,"58":8.0,"59":7.0,"60":11.667,"61":70.0,"156":1.0,"158":6.0,"184":1.0,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{},"appliedTotal":0.0,"externalId":"401128059","id":"01401128059","proTeamId":28,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{}},{"appliedAverage":17.233333333333334,"appliedStats":{"53":8.0,"42":25.700000000000003,"43":18.0},"appliedTotal":51.7,"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"41":16.0,"42":257.0,"43":3.0,"45":1.0,"46":1.0,"47":51.0,"48":25.0,"49":12.0,"50":9.0,"210":3.0,"51":4.0,"52":1.0,"53":16.0,"54":3.0,"183":1.0,"56":1.0,"184":1.0,"58":24.0,"59":59.0,"60":16.0625,"156":3.0,"61":85.66666667,"158":18.0}}],"universeId":2},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":8,"totalRanking":33,"totalRating":51.7}},"rosterLocked":true,"status":"ONTEAM","tradeLocked":false},"status":"NORMAL"},{"acquisitionDate":1568793341641,"acquisitionType":"ADD","injuryStatus":"NORMAL","lineupSlotId":20,"pendingTransactionIds":null,"playerId":3115394,"playerPoolEntry":{"appliedStatTotal":22.0,"id":3115394,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":true,"onTeamId":5,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":3,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":269,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},"PPR":{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":238,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[3,4,5,23,7,20,21],"firstName":"DJ","fullName":"DJ Chark Jr.","id":3115394,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","lastName":"Chark Jr.","lastNewsDate":1569813176000,"lastVideoDate":1569339973000,"outlooks":{"outlooksByWeek":{"1":"On pace to return from a preseason concussion, Chark will compete with several other veteran wideouts for targets to begin the year.

With an average depth of target just above 24 yards, Chark was a high-volume deep threat in a game the Jaguars were scrambling to come back in against the Chiefs. The Texans have been exploitable for wideouts since the start of last season, although it's not clear which Jacksonville receiver to trust in Week 2.","3":"Leading the Jaguars in receiving yardage through two games, Chark has found fun chemistry with quarterback Gardner Minshew.","4":"The team's leading receiver the past two weeks thanks to netting 14 targets with healthy air yardage during this sample, Chark is arguably the strongest fantasy option on the Jaguars' passing game at the moment.

It obviously wasn't a great start to Chark's career, but also nothing to overreact to. The team's quarterback situation has gone from terrible to Nick Foles, and Chark is still only 22 years old.

role, you can surely source stronger options than Robinson from your waiver wire.","2":"Fourth on the team in routes even in a game with Tyreek Hill absent, it's quite possible Robinson doesn't net much of a boost in usage or production with Hill sidelined. The Raiders present a fun matchup, but it's unlikely Robinson sees enough looks to earn the confidence of fantasy managers.","3":"Before delivering two scores in a breakout performance this past week, Robinson had four career touchdowns to his name. Robinson has now run more routes than Mecole Hardman on the season and is in stronger position to deliver flex-worthy production at home this Sunday.","4":"It's amazing to think Robinson has been targeted just 10 times the past two weeks and yet has converted them into nine catches for three scores and 215 yards. Pretty efficient of you, Demarcus.

learning Bruce Arians' offense this offseason. Mastering it quickly could give him huge fantasy upside, especially with a full season of TE O.J Howard in the fold. Though the 49ers defense has improved on paper, it's still a unit that allowed the most passing touchdowns last year (35). Winston will typically rank on the fence for QB1 value but, with a quick study in this scheme, could earn a more secure place there. Mark him in that tier for Week 1, though, considering the favorable matchup.","2":"Winston threw three interceptions in his first regular-season action in Bruce Arians' offense. While he could emerge as a more exciting fantasy option as he gains understanding of the system, while undergoing the transition, he will be quite the risky play. Against Carolina in Week 2 on Thursday night, he's best left as a second starting quarterback in 2-QB or superflex leagues. Otherwise, leave him on the bench until he shows he's worth anything more.","3":"Winston has struggled with the Buccaneers' new offense, failing to surpass 208 passing yards in either of his two contests to start 2019. Of course, a prime opportunity is lined up for Week 3 improvement versus the Giants defense, which has allowed the third-highest QB fantasy points-per-game rate (31.1) and passing yardage total (658) so far. At home, Winston again lines up as a borderline QB1.","4":"Winston unleashed against the Giants, chiefly via the hands and legs of big-play wideout Mike Evans, with whom he connected for three touchdowns. He averaged a whopping 10.3 yards-per-attempt on Sunday, improving on his 8.3 from Week 2. It seems that he's slowly getting more comfortable challenging downfield in Bruce Arians' system. However, the Rams have stifled QB production so far, giving up just 14 fantasy points-per-game (third-lowest rate). This puts Winston close to the border of being a QB1 for Week 4 fantasy lineups, though more comfortably into QB2 territory."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":0.08823529411764706,"averageDraftPosition":165.922,"percentChange":-0.3152988737041511,"percentOwned":44.83621933776499,"percentStarted":14.336333235502675},"proTeamId":27,"rankings":{"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":6.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":5.833333333333333,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":25.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":12.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":11.833333333333334,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":17,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":18.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":17.833333333333332,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}]},"seasonOutlook":"Winston's 2018 season was marred by a three-game suspension and an interception-fueled benching, but he still ended up showing improvement in several areas.

Winston also rushed for a career-high 281 yards despite appearing in just 11 games. During the nine weeks he started, Winston ranked fourth in fantasy points. He continues to struggle with interceptions (58 in 56 career games), though part of that is a product of a propensity for attacking deep down field (he's ranked top five in aDOT in all four seasons). Winston has flashed enough to keep him in the QB1 discussion.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":20.596690629999998,"appliedStats":{"19":2.609012928,"4":91.47468052,"20":-23.35752914,"8":142.0,"72":-9.111503756,"24":16.0608658,"25":6.514645548000001,"26":0.148965348,"63":0.224459682},"appliedTotal":226.56359693,"externalId":"2018","id":"102018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":467.4299404,"1":289.7666199,"2":177.6633205,"3":3570.342851,"4":22.86867013,"5":714.0,"6":357.0,"7":178.0,"8":142.0,"9":71.0,"10":35.0,"11":57.0,"12":28.0,"13":35.0,"14":17.0,"15":3.260154334,"16":2.130510857,"17":4.194034423,"18":0.566504082,"19":1.304506464,"20":11.67876457,"21":0.619914547,"22":276.0218671,"23":37.90865546,"24":160.608658,"25":1.085774258,"26":0.074482674,"27":32.0,"28":16.0,"29":8.0,"30":6.0,"31":3.0,"32":1.0,"33":7.0,"34":3.0,"35":0.071396008,"36":0.049977206,"37":0.085921316,"38":0.002932165,"39":4.236727893698818,"40":12.41659513,"62":1.378989138,"63":0.037409947,"64":33.17176495,"65":8.848971695,"66":0.670098834,"68":9.51907053,"69":4.247506414,"70":0.308245464,"72":4.555751878,"73":16.23451645,"210":11.0}},{"appliedAverage":19.448332885857145,"appliedStats":{"19":2.293116262,"4":104.46370404,"20":-33.60419608,"8":172.0,"72":-9.015195312,"24":27.474832590000002,"25":8.307631386,"26":0.134167516,"63":0.22260000000000002},"appliedTotal":272.276660402,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":534.9617471,"1":337.3330397,"2":197.6287074,"3":4310.520613,"4":26.11592601,"5":862.0,"6":431.0,"7":215.0,"8":172.0,"9":86.0,"10":43.0,"11":67.0,"12":33.0,"15":4.091062408,"16":2.673509284,"17":5.798593322,"18":0.783237918,"19":1.146558131,"20":16.80209804,"21":0.630574133,"22":292.4369479,"23":60.53067659,"24":274.7483259,"25":1.384605231,"26":0.067083758,"27":54.0,"28":27.0,"29":13.0,"30":10.0,"31":5.0,"33":12.0,"34":6.0,"35":0.115024227,"36":0.080516959,"37":0.212310558,"38":0.007245345,"39":4.538993143,"40":18.63964219,"62":1.213641889,"63":0.0371,"64":38.69444898,"65":8.528427195,"66":0.899896962,"68":9.428324158,"69":4.093645054,"70":0.413952603,"72":4.507597656,"73":21.30969569,"210":14.74}},{"appliedStats":{"4":12.0,"20":-2.0,"8":15.0,"24":0.30000000000000004},"appliedTotal":25.3,"externalId":"401127966","id":"01401127966","proTeamId":27,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"0":37.0,"1":23.0,"2":14.0,"3":380.0,"4":3.0,"5":76.0,"6":38.0,"7":19.0,"8":15.0,"9":7.0,"10":3.0,"11":4.0,"12":2.0,"13":2.0,"14":1.0,"17":1.0,"20":1.0,"21":62.162,"22":380.0,"23":4.0,"24":3.0,"39":0.75,"40":3.0,"64":4.0,"73":1.0,"156":1.0,"175":1.0,"177":2.0,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"19":0.1278535,"4":6.080481804,"20":-2.691952136,"8":11.0,"72":-0.631751098,"24":1.8147094630000002,"25":0.42700195799999996,"26":0.008174686,"63":0.015570353999999998},"appliedTotal":16.150088531,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"0":36.90731596,"1":22.54658609,"2":14.36072987,"3":285.5551137,"4":1.520120451,"5":57.0,"6":28.0,"7":14.0,"8":11.0,"9":5.0,"10":2.0,"11":4.0,"12":2.0,"15":0.269586899,"16":0.176175038,"17":0.375049002,"18":0.050659286,"19":0.06392675,"20":1.345976068,"21":0.610897474,"22":285.5551137,"23":3.576328377,"24":18.14709463,"25":0.071166993,"26":0.004087343,"27":3.0,"28":1.0,"35":0.006775594,"36":0.004742916,"37":0.014312226,"38":4.88421E-4,"39":5.074224935,"40":18.14709463,"62":0.068014093,"63":0.002595059,"64":3.32033669,"65":0.60640922,"66":0.053911137,"68":0.660320357,"69":0.291076425,"70":0.024799123,"72":0.315875549,"73":1.661851617,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"19":0.167254758,"4":7.168322468,"20":-2.011993792,"8":10.0,"72":-0.635114764,"24":1.6539876329999998,"25":0.564490854,"26":0.007528356,"63":0.015660642},"appliedTotal":16.930136155,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"0":32.96171681,"1":20.1778828,"2":12.78383401,"3":256.8131093,"4":1.792080617,"5":51.0,"6":25.0,"7":12.0,"8":10.0,"9":5.0,"10":2.0,"11":4.0,"12":2.0,"15":0.221205062,"16":0.144557508,"17":0.247238673,"18":0.033395462,"19":0.083627379,"20":1.005996896,"21":0.61216116,"22":256.8131093,"23":3.602043822,"24":16.53987633,"25":0.094081809,"26":0.003764178,"27":3.0,"28":1.0,"35":0.006825885,"36":0.00477812,"37":0.0118785,"38":4.05E-4,"39":4.591803194,"40":16.53987633,"62":0.087391558,"63":0.002610107,"64":2.199122545,"65":0.602433254,"66":0.061716131,"68":0.664149385,"69":0.289167962,"70":0.02838942,"72":0.317557382,"73":1.323554278,"210":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":18.546343821666664,"appliedStats":{"19":1.767551938,"4":83.53572856,"20":-28.45915602,"8":144.0,"72":-7.874744082,"24":23.56075153,"25":5.726743428000001,"26":0.105139412,"63":0.194111094},"appliedTotal":222.55612585999998,"externalId":"2019","id":"122019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPe

in the preseason, Jones will start the 2019 season behind starting QB Eli Manning. It's difficult to justify using a roster spot on him in single-season leagues just yet, but dynasty players should consider stashing him if roster size allows it.","2":"Jones made his debut in Week 1 garbage time but lost a fumble. He'll continue backing up Eli Manning and remains more of a dynasty-league fantasy prospect than a roster-worthy player in single-year leagues.","3":"The Giants announced on Tuesday that Jones will take over as starting quarterback, supplanting Eli Manning. His first assignment in Week 3 looks promising against the Buccaneers, who have been somewhat fortunate to face Jimmy Garoppolo and an injured Cam Newton. Not that Jones is spectacular, and the Giants receiving corps is ravaged with injuries and a suspended Golden Tate, but anyone with Saquon Barkley and Evan Engram as receiving options has a fine starting point. If either Sterling Shepard or Cody Latimer returns from a concussion, Jones is squarely in consideration for a starting spot in 2-QB fantasy leagues.","4":"The Daniel Jones era started off with a fury as the rookie accounted for four total touchdowns (two rushing) against the Buccaneers in Week 3. That defense was a pushover, but Washington's has also been easy to conquer. The Redskins have allowed 28.1 QB fantasy points-per-game -- the fifth-highest average in the league. Though expecting a repeat of his debut is a stretch, he should still border on fantasy QB1 numbers in Week 4. Those deploying him as a QB2 in 2-QB lineups should be giddy."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":0.8622291021671826,"averageDraftPosition":156.53122134222593,"percentChange":53.073090610042755,"percentOwned":64.3340467666616,"percentStarted":36.78195149367515},"proTeamId":19,"rankings":{"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":24,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":22,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":23.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":23.666666666666668,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":23,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":21,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":21,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":11.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":10.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}]},"seasonOutlook":"The Giants selected Jones with the sixth overall pick in April's draft. The 6-foot-5, 221-pound Duke product was far from impressive in his final FBS season. Jones was off target on 9.4 percent of his throws (best in this class), but he was very conservative (8.1 aDOT), which led to a weak 6.8 YPA. Jones did deal with a ton of drops, but his weak efficiency and struggles throwing the deep ball are red flags. Jones is a good athlete who will add some value at the pro level with his legs. Eli Manning will be the team's starter as long as he's healthy and the Giants are competitive this season, but Jones figures to get a few starts late in the season. He's only a fantasy option in dynasty.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":13.052647870166668,"appliedStats":{"19":0.853026522,"4":29.489688028,"20":-10.325488736,"8":49.0,"72":-2.594007192,"24":8.078145151,"25":3.704532294,"26":0.046049106,"63":0.063942048},"appliedTotal":78.31588722100001,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":175.9426717,"1":109.9234116,"2":66.01926007,"3":1245.195362,"4":7.372422007,"5":249.0,"6":124.0,"7":62.0,"8":49.0,"9":24.0,"10":12.0,"11":21.0,"12":10.0,"15":1.020388599,"16":0.666823949,"17":1.02590644,"18":0.138573061,"19":0.426513261,"20":5.162744368,"21":0.624768344,"22":204.1303872,"23":17.63460796,"24":80.78145151,"25":0.617422049,"26":0.023024553,"27":16.0,"28":8.0,"29":4.0,"30":3.0,"31":1.0,"33":3.0,"34":1.0,"35":0.033357845,"36":0.023350491,"37":0.054783305,"38":0.001869544,"39":4.580847596,"40":13.2428609,"62":0.449537814,"63":0.010657008,"64":13.62876199,"65":2.480922603,"66":0.230784231,"68":2.711706834,"69":1.190842849,"70":0.106160746,"72":1.297003596,"73":6.459747963,"210":6.1}},{"appliedStats":{"19":2.0,"4":8.0,"8":13.0,"72":-4.0,"24":2.8000000000000003,"25":12.0},"appliedTotal":33.8,"externalId":"401127966","id":"01401127966","proTeamId":19,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"0":36.0,"1":23.0,"2":13.0,"3":336.0,"4":2.0,"5":67.0,"6":33.0,"7":16.0,"8":13.0,"9":6.0,"10":3.0,"11":4.0,"12":2.0,"13":2.0,"14":1.0,"15":1.0,"16":1.0,"17":1.0,"19":1.0,"21":63.889,"22":336.0,"23":4.0,"24":28.0,"25":2.0,"27":5.0,"28":2.0,"29":1.0,"30":1.0,"39":7.0,"40":28.0,"64":5.0,"65":2.0,"68":2.0,"69":2.0,"72":2.0,"73":2.0,"108":1.0,"109":1.0,"155":1.0,"158":12.0,"175":1.0,"179":2.0,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"19":0.198590972,"4":6.897130528,"20":-1.39015369,"8":9.0,"72":-0.797711746,"24":2.113072898,"25":1.318732662,"26":0.015909174,"63":0.01968},"appliedTotal":17.375250798000003,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"0":34.33061136,"1":21.40837713,"2":12.92223423,"3":247.9296727,"4":1.724282632,"5":49.0,"6":24.0,"7":12.0,"8":9.0,"9":4.0,"10":2.0,"11":4.0,"12":2.0,"15":0.207232056,"16":0.135426148,"17":0.216100976,"18":0.029189576,"19":0.099295486,"20":0.695076845,"21":0.623594404,"22":247.9296727,"23":4.226145797,"24":21.13072898,"25":0.219788777,"26":0.007954587,"27":4.0,"28":2.0,"29":1.0,"35":0.008053299,"36":0.005637309,"37":0.019431064,"38":6.63E-4,"39":5.0,"40":21.13072898,"62":0.107250073,"63":0.00328,"64":3.166819007,"65":0.749948607,"66":0.084522916,"68":0.834471523,"69":0.359975332,"70":0.038880541,"72":0.398855873,"73":1.093932718,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"19":0.139940616,"4":4.667104996,"20":-1.584907004,"8":9.0,"72":-0.528547186,"24":1.9052680450000001,"25":0.735603816,"26":0.008858508,"63":0.013031436},"appliedTotal":14.356353227,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"0":35.95303118,"1":22.23627367,"2":13.7167575,"3":247.4535428,"4":1.166776249,"5":49.0,"6":24.0,"7":12.0,"8":9.0,"9":4.0,"10":2.0,"11":4.0,"12":2.0,"15":0.206496212,"16":0.134945275,"17":0.214534821,"18":0.028978029,"19":0.069970308,"20":0.792453502,"21":0.618481195,"22":247.4535428,"23":3.810536089,"24":19.05268045,"25":0.122600636,"26":0.004429254,"27":3.0,"28":1.0,"35":0.007234455,"36":0.005064118,"37":0.015783331,"38":5.38625E-4,"39":5.0,"40":19.05268045,"62":0.074399562,"63":0.002171906,"64":2.465175826,"65":0.502779328,"66":0.049868511,"68":0.552647839,"69":0.241334078,"70":0.022939515,"72":0.264273593,"73":1.056727094,"210":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":18.540772604666667,"appliedStats":{"19":2.225391846,"4":77.59555528,"20":-22.20481808,"8":134.0,"72":-10.789162536,"24":27.10499774,"25":14.115216474,"26":0.176006846,"63":0.266083686},"appliedTotal":222.489271256,"externalId":"2019","id":"122019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{"0":469.7603539,"1":297.214889,"2":172.545465,"3":3350.780179,"4":19.39888882,"5":670.0,"6":335.0,"7":167.0,"8":134.0,"9":67.0,"10":33.0,"11":59.0,"12":29.0,"15":2.898203769,"16":1.893976163,"17":3.284353158,"18":0.443629995,"19":1.112695923,"20":11.10240904,"21":0.632694706,"22":258.9474636,"23":54.70138591,"24":271.0499774,"25":2.352536079,"26":0.088003423,"27":54.0,"28":27.0,"29":13.0,"30":10.0,"31":5.0,"33":10.0,"34":5.0,"35":0.104223258,"36":0.072956281,"37":0.246241287,"38":0.00840327,"39":4.95508428,"40":20.94667523,"62":1.200699346,"63":0.044347281,"64":39.7530333,"65":10.19026774,"66":1.094027718,"68":11.28429546,"69":4.891328517,"70":0.50325275,"72":5.394581268,"73":16.49699031,"210":12.94}},{"appliedStats":{"4":4.0,"20":-4.0,"8":9.0,"24":3.3000000000000003},"appliedTotal":12.3,"externalId":"401128059","id":"01401128059","proTeamId":19,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"0":31

certainly there for  Johnson last season, but the efficiency was not. That said, his 308 total touches propelled him to an eighth-place finish among running backs in total scoring. He'll be the focal point of Arizona's offense again this season alongside new quarterback Kyler Murray, and should be started until further notice.","2":"Johnson was involved in all facets of the Arizona offense to open the season, showing good rapport with rookie Kyler Murray and catching 6-of-7 targets for 55 yards and a touchdown. He's on pace for well over 300 touches -- a number only an injury will stop him from reaching. The Ravens do not offer an appealing matchup, nor does a trip across the country inspire much confidence, but Johnson is still squarely among the RB1 ranks. He deserves a spot in any fantasy lineup.","3":"After a Week 2 injury scare forced Johnson out of the game for a series and limited his overall playing time (only 36 snaps), things appear to be fine for the superstar running back. The Cardinals have been keeping games close so far this season and should be able to provide Johnson with his normal workload this week -- assuming his wrist cooperates. Keep an eye on his injury status, as the only way you'll bench him against a mediocre Panthers defense is if he's ruled out.","4":"Johnson bounced back in Week 3, finding the end zone and posting a respectable score on the back of his prowess in the passing game. Johnson has 17 targets on the season and is clearly a key figure in the passing game, which is something that can also be said for Alvin Kamara of the Saints. Kamara had a huge game through the air in Week 3 against Seattle, who will travel to Arizona to face the Cardinals in Week 4. That's the silver lining on what promises to be a tough matchup for the star running back, but it's enough to say he's an RB1 in all formats."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":44.297213622291025,"averageDraftPosition":10.392148691448575,"percentChange":0.002602678244784329,"percentOwned":99.87675355624017,"percentStarted":97.74026826571392},"proTeamId":22,"rankings":{"0":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2}],"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":4.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":5.333333333333333,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":6.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":6.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":5.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":5.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":17,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":17,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":17,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},

An injury cost him all but 43 snaps in 2017, and inefficient play in a weak offense limited him to only two top-10 fantasy weeks (24 backs had more) in 2018. Johnson's yards per carry plummeted to 3.64, his YAC to 1.44 (seventh-worst among running backs) and his catch rate to 66 percent (second-worst). On the plus side, Johnson ranked top-five at the position in snaps (714) and touches (308), which allowed him his third top-10 fantasy campaign in four seasons. The 27-year-old workhorse is expected to retain a hefty role in new coach Kliff Kingsbury's offense. An intriguing bounce-back candidate, Johnson is a mid-pack

large role as the key playmaker for a Jets team in dire need of creation, Bell should see a sizable workload against a stout Bills defense that allowed the 11th-fewest yards per carry last season. Even with a tough matchup the hope is that a heavy workload helps Bell match or best his projection this week.","2":"Yardage was hard to come by against Buffalo this past Sunday afternoon, but touches weren't for Bell, as he led the team with 23. Most valuably, Bell netted nine targets in the loss. Supporting a strong projection for this week against the Browns is the fact Cleveland has allowed 4.75 yards per carry to tailbacks over 365 carries dating back to Week 1 last season, the eighth-highest allowance in the league during this sample.","3":"Back to seeing the amazing workload he enjoyed with the Steelers, Bell is again a top-five fantasy back thanks to his rare blend of volume and skills. The Patriots could knock the Jets out of this game early, but this could see Bell earn a glut of targets in similar fashion to Week 2's 10-catch outing."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":43.77554179566563,"averageDraftPosition":12.479746624437407,"percentChange":-0.3511643964537541,"percentOwned":99.48602572363292,"percentStarted":27.45408655472057},"proTeamId":20,"rankings":{"0":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2}],"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":9.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":10.166666666666666,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":3.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":4.666666666666667,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":8.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":8.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}]},"seasonOutlook":"Bell has signed on with the Jets after infamously sitting out the entire 2018 season due to a contract dispute. A longtime NFL workhorse, Bell ranked first among running backs in snaps (3,449), fourth in carries (1,229), third in rushing yards (5,336), fourth in rushing touchdowns (35), first in targets (390) and first in receiving yards (312) from 2013-17 despite missing 18 of 80 possible games. Bell, who has appeared in all 16 regular-season games once in his career, saw his efficiency take a dip in 2017, but pacing the position in rushes and receptions was enough to help him post his third top-three-overall fantasy season in four years. Jets coach Adam Gase's tendency to pass near the goal line (NFL-low 23 carries inside the 5 during his three seasons in Miami) could cost Bell some touchdowns, but the former Steeler won't have trouble generating big volume in an improving offense. He's a solid RB1.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":15.710253364500003,"appliedStats":{"53":32.35,"72":-2.279281704,"24":106.64000000000001,"25":48.0,"26":0.618829962,"42":51.36000000000001,"43":14.399999999999999,"44":0.218596872,"63":0.055908702000000005},"appliedTotal":251.36405383200005,"externalId":"2018","id":"102018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":248.5,"24":1066.4,"25":8.0,"26":0.309414981,"27":213.0,"28":106.0,"29":53.0,"30":42.0,"31":21.0,"32":10.0,"33":49.0,"34":24.0,"35":0.536458907,"36":0.375521235,"37":3.840710758,"38":0.131068723,"39":4.291348088531188,"40":87.5002761,"41":64.7,"42":513.6,"43":2.4,"44":0.109298436,"45":0.05197957,"46":0.033968649,"47":102.0,"48":51.0,"49":25.0,"50":20.0,"51":10.0,"52":5.0,"53":64.7,"54":12.0,"55":6.0,"56":0.658090594,"57":0.020353317,"58":81.3,"60":7.938176197836167,"61":42.14282364,"62":0.418713417,"63":0.009318117,"66":1.881315886,"67":0.489706329,"68":2.4,"70":0.865405308,"71":0.274235544,"72":1.139640852,"73":1.139640852,"210":16.0}},{"appliedAverage":16.469898184266665,"appliedStats":{"53":32.27833858,"72":-2.080316994,"24":112.1908062,"25":36.892542612,"26":0.513733022,"42":50.911056650000006,"43":16.04140788,"44":0.249864524,"63":0.05104029},"appliedTotal":247.048472764,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":249.7297966,"24":1121.908062,"25":6.148757102,"26":0.256866511,"27":224.0,"28":112.0,"29":56.0,"30":44.0,"31":22.0,"33":49.0,"34":24.0,"35":0.524684407,"36":0.367279085,"37":3.487839521,"38":0.119026581,"39":4.492487791,"40":74.48352281,"42":509.1105665,"43":2.67356798,"44":0.124932262,"45":0.058337485,"46":0.038123546,"47":101.0,"48":50.0,"49":25.0,"50":20.0,"51":10.0,"53":64.55667716,"54":12.0,"55":6.0,"56":0.449012553,"57":0.013886986,"58":82.62393943,"60":7.8862573,"61":33.79987164,"62":0.381798772,"63":0.008506715,"66":1.719942814,"67":0.444615719,"68":2.164558533,"70":0.791173694,"71":0.248984802,"72":1.040158497,"73":1.040158497,"210":15.0625}},{"appliedStats":{},"appliedTotal":0.0,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{}},{"appliedStats":{"53":3.046747342,"72":-0.218791264,"24":6.15328379,"25":1.287450342,"26":0.01980228,"42":4.520552536,"43":0.8569926720000001,"44":0.013977576,"63":0.005274},"appliedTotal":15.685289274,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":14.704712,"24":61.5328379,"25":0.214575057,"26":0.00990114,"27":12.0,"28":6.0,"29":3.0,"30":2.0,"31":1.0,"33":2.0,"34":1.0,"35":0.030634735,"36":0.021444315,"37":0.165641372,"38":0.005652705,"39":4.184566002,"40":61.5328379,"42":45.20552536,"43":0.142832112,"44":0.006988788,"45":0.002706019,"46":0.001768383,"47":9.0,"48":4.0,"49":2.0,"50":1.0,"53":6.093494684,"54":1.0,"56":0.073219349,"57":0.002264516,"58":7.884127162,"60":7.418653451,"61":45.20552536,"62":0.016889928,"63":8.79E-4,"66":0.158072754,"67":0.065503866,"68":0.22357662,"70":0.072713467,"71":0.036682165,"72":0.109395632,"73":0.109395632,"210":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":16.879726804,"appliedStats":{"53":30.78456502,"72":-2.815165958,"24":102.702776,"25":23.624095506,"26":0.398728604,"42":46.73924183,"43":17.674473845999998,"44":0.258618596,"63":0.069115008},"appliedTotal":219.436448452,"externalId":"2019","id":"122019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{"23":242.8403,"24":1027.02776,"25":3.937349251,"26":0.199364302,"27":205.0,"28":102.0,"29":51.0,"30":41.0,"31":20.0,"33":48.0,"34":24.0,"35":0.523207506,"36":0.366245254,"37":3.608275259,"38":0.123136591,"39":4.229231143,"40":79.00213536,"42":467.3924183,"43":2.945745641,"44":0.129309298,"45":0.040906105,"46":0.02673214,"47":93.0,"48":46.0,"49":23.0,"50":18.0,"51":9.0,"53":61.56913004,"54":12.0,"55":6.0,"56":0.508660038,"57":0.015731754,"58":78.7798008,"60":7.591343551,"61":35.95326295,"62":0.3286736,"63":0.011519168,"66":2.338251437,"67":0.592834496,"68":2.931085933,"70":1.075595661,"71":0.331987318,"72":1.407582979,"73":1.407582979,"210":13.0}},{"appliedAverage":0.0,"appliedStats":{},"appliedTotal":0.0,"externalId":"2018","id":"002018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"155":9.0,"156":6.0,"157":1.0,"174":0.5625,"210":16.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":2.0,"24":3.5,"42":2.8000000000000003},"appliedTotal":8.3,"externalId":"401127861","id":"01401127861","proTeamId":20,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":18.0,"24":35.0,"27":7.0,"28":3.0,"29":1.0,"30":1.0,"33":3.0,"34":1.0,"39":1.944,"40":35.0,"41":4.0,"42":28.0,"47":5.0,"48":2.0,"49":1.0,"50":1.0,"53":4.0,"58":4.0,"59":33.0,"60":7.0,"61":28.0,"156":1.0,"210":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":14.800000000000002,"appliedStats":{"53":10.0,"72":-2.0,"

(foot/heel) looked like he should be on a normal practice course on the way to suiting up in Week 1. Watch to see if that changes but, if he's on the field, he's the best bet to be Dak Prescott's top receiver. He's probably going to have to deal with Giants CB Janoris Jenkins, who helped hold Cooper to a five-catch, 31-yard day in a Week 16 meeting last season. Cooper's health concerns and Dallas' possible need not to do much through the air in this one should force fantasy managers to consider him as a fantasy WR2 for the opener.","2":"Cooper was targeted nine times in Week 1, catching six balls for 106 yards and a score. That should calm concerns over his preseason lower-body injury. Kellen Moore's offense looks exciting enough to possibly elevate Dak Prescott to a must-start fantasy quarterback, and Cooper's comfort with the starter keeps him in fantasy WR1 territory, too. Even with solid CB Josh Norman potentially shadowing him, it's hard to ding his Week 2 value too much. In Week 10 last year, Cooper obliterated Washington for a ridiculous 8-180-2 day on nine targets. ","3":"In Week 2, Cooper found the end zone for the second straight week to begin the 2019 season. So far, QB Dak Prescott looks like an MVP in Kellen Moore's new system. Though the Dolphins defense that awaits in Week 3 has been obliterated for two straight games, CB Xavien Howard remains solid-to-great, and he'll probably stick on Cooper most of the day. That being said, Howard has almost no help, so Cooper still could be in position to deliver WR2 fantasy numbers. The floor isn't all that low unless he's removed early thanks to a blowout. Unless your receiver corps is stacked, don't consider benching him.","4":"Cooper scored two touchdowns in a Week 3 blowout win, showing little trouble working against Dolphins CB Xavien Howard. Next up, he will tangle with Saints CB Marshon Lattimore, who gets a lot of takeaways but has wilted against top wideouts in recent memory. Cooper remains a strong fantasy WR2 and could even pass as a WR1 for Week 4."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":32.15325077399381,"averageDraftPosition":23.249291548591433,"percentChange":0.024302424317497184,"percentOwned":99.72082691054855,"percentStarted":94.57880178425852},"proTeamId":6,"rankings":{"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":17,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":10.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":13.166666666666666,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":12.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":12.666666666666666,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":7.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":9.166666666666666,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":22,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":22,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":22,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":10.0,"published":

kicked off his career with a pair of 1,000-yard and top 25 fantasy seasons in Oakland, but it took a trade to Dallas last season for him to really take off. Cooper, who handled 21 percent target share in Oakland, had a career-high 25 percent share in 11 games with Dallas. In fact, he never fell below a 16 percent share in a single game and was fantasy's No. 9 wide receiver from Week 9 on. Cooper's boost in volume coincided with improved efficiency (he caught a career-high 71 percent of his targets and averaged a career-best 9.5 YPT), which is enough to make the 25-year-old a strong WR2 with top-10

the unquestioned top option in the passing game for Seattle now that Doug Baldwin is no longer on the roster. The Kansas State product had already passed the veteran Baldwin in terms of fantasy appeal thanks to his eye-catching 16.9 yards-per-reception and 10 touchdowns in 2018. The Bengals are a middle-of-the-road matchup for receivers based on last season's performances, meaning there's no need to worry about Lockett if he's your WR2 in Week 1.","2":"Lockett picked up a touchdown on his only catch of the game in Week 1 -- a fitting reminder of the sort of player he is as he begins his fifth season as a pro. Last year, he scored a touchdown for every seven targets he saw, so scoring on limited chances seems to be a skill for Lockett. Still, you can expect more than two targets in Week 2 against a Steelers defense that struggled against the Patriots in Week 1. As such, he's a borderline WR2, with lots of big-play upside.","3":"Despite possessing game-changing athleticism, Lockett has almost half the yards-per-catch of teammate DK Metcalf. That's not what fantasy managers want to see, but that could all change in Week 3. The Saints have allowed 443 yards on 24 catches by wideouts so far this season, including five grabs for 120 yards by Cooper Kupp in Week 2. That bodes well for Lockett, who is certainly capable of breaking off a big play and making a big impact on your fantasy matchup. He's a solid flex option.","4":"Lockett had a huge game in Week 3 and will look to build upon that against the Cardinals in Week 4. The Kansas State product saw double-digit targets for the second week in a row and found the end zone for the second time this season. He'll be a favorite to repeat against an Arizona defense which has allowed the fourth-most points per game in the NFL this season."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":12.018575851393189,"averageDraftPosition":59.698257897807785,"percentChange":1.4313257345529138,"percentOwned":97.34984571263391,"percentStarted":79.2028889543916},"proTeamId":26,"rankings":{"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":21,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":21,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":20,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":17,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":18.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":18.833333333333332,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":22,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":26,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":26,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":23,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":27,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":21,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":17,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":24.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":24.833333333333332,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":22,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":24,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":24,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":17,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":18.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":21.333333333333332,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":23,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":23,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":23,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":9

defied logic last season by posting an absurd 57/965/10 line on only 68 targets. Lockett had posted between 64 and 69 targets during each of his first three NFL seasons but never cleared 51 receptions, 664 yards or six touchdowns. Lockett, who hasn't dropped a pass since 2016, caught 84 percent of his targets (second best), posted a 14.2 YPT (best) and scored on 14.7 percent of his targets (second best). Lockett was fantasy's No. 16 receiver (his first career top 40) despite managing only one weekly finish better than 14th. Needless to say, Lockett's efficiency isn't close to sustainable and that includes touchdowns (he scored 10 times despite a 3.0 OTD and seven end zone targets). Lockett is a very good player but he needs more volume to be more than a WR3/flex option. He figures to get it following Doug Baldwin's retirement.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":8.150605271625,"appliedStats":{"53":24.42340323,"101":2.0061128040000002,"102":1.871441676,"72":-0.345710722,"24":8.891183203999999,"25":2.16174996,"26":0.027100922,"42":67.49946411,"43":23.495287679999997,"44":0.372101562,"63":0.00754992},"appliedTotal":130.409684346,"externalId":"2018","id":"102018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":12.31564313,"24":88.91183204,"25":0.36029166,"26":0.013550461,"27":17.0,"28":8.0,"29":4.0,"30":3.0,"31":1.0,"33":2.0,"34":1.0,"35":0.022746822,"36":0.015922775,"37":0.021077772,"38":7.19304E-4,"39":7.219422575132704,"40":5.556989502,"41":48.84680646,"42":674.9946411,"43":3.91588128,"44":0.186050781,"45":0.270822751,"46":0.176982668,"47":134.0,"48":67.0,"49":33.0,"50":26.0,"51":13.0,"52":6.0,"53":48.84680646,"54":9.0,"55":4.0,"56":0.971242274,"57":0.030038421,"58":75.64947861,"60":13.818603303221963,"61":42.18716507,"62":0.199601242,"63":0.00125832,"66":0.064471931,"67":0.255711202,"68":0.320183133,"70":0.029657088,"71":0.143198273,"72":0.172855361,"73":0.172855361,"101":0.334352134,"102":0.311906946,"114":769.5308969,"115":244.3651881,"210":16.0}},{"appliedAverage":10.856593017375001,"appliedStats":{"53":34.06851735,"101":1.364731848,"102":1.7347668719999998,"72":-0.780153212,"24":5.658346764000001,"25":1.22617884,"26":0.012924302,"42":95.34237423,"43":34.549829946,"44":0.511171338,"63":0.0168},"appliedTotal":173.70548827800002,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":9.135079257,"24":56.58346764,"25":0.20436314,"26":0.006462151,"27":11.0,"28":5.0,"29":2.0,"30":2.0,"31":1.0,"33":1.0,"35":0.016841742,"36":0.01178922,"37":0.00841196,"38":2.87E-4,"39":6.194086121,"40":3.536466728,"42":953.4237423,"43":5.758304991,"44":0.255585669,"45":0.453859341,"46":0.29659708,"47":190.0,"48":95.0,"49":47.0,"50":38.0,"51":19.0,"53":68.1370347,"54":13.0,"55":6.0,"56":2.451121691,"57":0.075807887,"58":92.71861465,"60":13.99273899,"61":59.58898389,"62":0.26204782,"63":0.0028,"66":0.08412359,"67":0.627463847,"68":0.711587437,"70":0.038696851,"71":0.351379755,"72":0.390076606,"73":0.390076606,"101":0.227455308,"102":0.289127812,"114":603.9126154,"115":231.0007518,"116":60.0,"117":24.0,"118":23.0,"119":9.0,"210":16.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":2.5555333995,"101":0.120172434,"102":0.112437804,"72":-0.053214528,"24":0.403325992,"25":0.123025524,"26":0.001328054,"42":7.1080863480000005,"43":2.563224246,"44":0.037006004,"63":0.00114},"appliedTotal":12.9720652775,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":0.58937921,"24":4.03325992,"25":0.020504254,"26":6.64027E-4,"35":0.001086758,"36":7.6073E-4,"37":6.84E-4,"38":2.33E-5,"39":6.84323412,"40":4.03325992,"42":71.08086348,"43":0.427204041,"44":0.018503002,"45":0.026193982,"46":0.017117767,"47":14.0,"48":7.0,"49":3.0,"50":2.0,"51":1.0,"53":5.111066799,"54":1.0,"56":0.233531377,"57":0.00722,"58":7.067347121,"60":13.90724604,"61":71.08086348,"62":0.019167029,"63":1.9E-4,"66":0.005004854,"67":0.043401842,"68":0.048406696,"70":0.002302233,"71":0.024305031,"72":0.026607264,"73":0.026607264,"101":0.020028739,"102":0.018739634,"114":53.71579832,"115":14.91098592,"116":5.0,"117":2.0,"118":1.0,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":2.128424601,"101":0.12159282,"102":0.113163714,"72":-0.045335718,"24":0.4007548053,"25":0.109258578,"26":0.001184912,"42":6.00213093,"43":2.102089248,"44":0.030489296,"63":9.780000000000001E-4},"appliedTotal":10.964731186300002,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":0.585621942,"24":4.007548053,"25":0.018209763,"26":5.92456E-4,"35":0.001079792,"36":7.55855E-4,"37":6.74899E-4,"38":2.30317E-5,"39":6.84323412,"40":4.007548053,"42":60.0213093,"43":0.350348208,"44":0.015244648,"45":0.026297991,"46":0.017185737,"47":12.0,"48":6.0,"49":3.0,"50":2.0,"51":1.0,"53":4.256849202,"56":0.155460362,"57":0.004808052,"58":5.961052744,"60":14.09993788,"61":60.0213093,"62":0.015837105,"63":1.63E-4,"66":0.005003274,"67":0.036368487,"68":0.041371761,"70":0.002301506,"71":0.020366353,"72":0.022667859,"73":0.022667859,"101":0.02026547,"102":0.018860619,"114":53.80649573,"115":15.06100719,"116":5.0,"117":2.0,"118":1.0,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":2.0,"42":5.1000000000000005},"appliedTotal":7.1000000000000005,"externalId":"401128064","id":"01401128064","proTeamId":26,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"41":4.0,"42":51.0,"47":10.0,"48":5.0,"49":2.0,"210":1.0,"114":21.0,"50":2.0,"115":-3.0,"51":1.0,"116":2.0,"53":4.0,"58":4.0,"59":9.0,"155":1.0,"60":12.75,"61":51.0}},{"appliedAverage":12.496115322,"appliedStats":{"53":32.61385222,"101":0.25719906600000003,"102":1.4676594,"72":-0.676766614,"24":4.924630572000001,"25":1.576476654,"26":0.016

Steve Smith clone, Moore looks primed to be the Panthers' No. 1 wideout this season, though Christian McCaffrey, Greg Olsen and Curtis Samuel will all eat into his ceiling. Cam Newton's health (foot) could compromise his ability in Week 1, but assuming he's set to go, Moore should slot in as a WR2/WR3 for Week 1 against the Rams. Carolina likely will have to sling the ball around to keep pace in the second half.","2":"Moore led the way among Panthers receiving options in Week 1, catching 7-of-10 targets. Still, he took a back seat to Christian McCaffrey (206 scrimmage yards, 2 TDs). Moore could be even busier in Week 2 against the Buccaneers if TE Greg Olsen (back) has to miss the contest. Count Moore as a solid fantasy WR2.","3":"Moore enjoyed a 14-target, 9-catch Week 2 but stands to be the player most negatively impacted if QB Cam Newton (foot) has to miss Week 3 at Arizona. If Kyle Allen or Will Grier takes snaps, Moore's ceiling takes a major dent. Fantasy managers can hope that his talent wins out. Expect him to put up fantasy WR3 numbers, especially with Cardinals CB Patrick Peterson's suspension removing a centerpiece of the defense.","4":"Moore slipped down to just two targets as Kyle Allen took over for QB Cam Newton (foot) in Week 3, but he made his one catch count -- a 52-yard catch-and-run for a touchdown. Allen's presence in Week 4 shouldn't scare off Moore's shareholders from starting him, etiher. Houston has allowed the fifth-highest WR fantasy points-per-game.

He ended up 31st at the position in receiving yards (788) despite ranking 53rd in pass routes (406) thanks to a league-best average of 7.7 yards after catch. He was limited to two touchdowns (2.2 OTD), but offset that a bit with 172 rushing yards. The versatile 22-year-old is now Carolina's clear No. 1 wide receiver and well positioned for a second-year breakout.

The culprit, of course, has been injuries. Henry missed three games during his first two seasons while also being limited by the presence of Antonio Gates. The 2016 second-round pick was on the verge of a 2018 promotion and likely breakout, but a torn ACL cost him the entire regular season (he did return and play 13 snaps in the playoffs). Henry has posted a career 81-1,057-12 line with 20 end-zone targets in 29 games. His efficiency has been terrific (70 percent catch rate, 9.3 YPT), and he's still only 24 years old. Now healthy and finally positioned for a full-time role in a good Chargers offense, Henry has breakout written all over him. He's a fringe top-five fantasy tight end.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":0.0,"appliedStats":{},"appliedTotal":0.0,"externalId":"2018","id":"102018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"210":16.0}},{"appliedAverage":0.0,"appliedStats":{},"appliedTotal":0.0,"externalId":"20190","id":"1020190","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"appliedAverage":9.1213638134,"appliedStats":{"53":26.994072945,"72":-0.722848076,"42":68.60469712000001,"43":41.299552266,"44":0.629764414,"63":0.015218532},"appliedTotal":136.820457201,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"42":686.0469712,"43":6.883258711,"44":0.314882207,"45":0.240009424,"46":0.156846159,"47":137.0,"48":68.0,"49":34.0,"50":27.0,"51":13.0,"53":53.98814589,"54":10.0,"55":5.0,"56":1.017368245,"57":0.031464997,"58":79.356952,"60":12.70736307,"61":45.54668689,"62":0.314882207,"63":0.002536422,"67":0.645400068,"68":0.645400068,"71":0.361424038,"72":0.361424038,"73":0.361424038,"210":15.0625}},{"appliedStats":{},"appliedTotal":0.0,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{}},{"appliedStats":{},"appliedTotal":0.0,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{}},{"appliedAverage":8.5995450358,"appliedStats":{"53":17.90386395,"72":-0.474770248,"42":45.62505104,"43":22.5860925,"44":0.345217506,"63":0.009995609999999999},"appliedTotal":85.995450358,"externalId":"2019","id":"122019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{"42":456.2505104,"43":3.76434875,"44":0.172608753,"45":0.152893334,"46":0.099915794,"47":91.0,"48":45.0,"49":22.0,"50":18.0,"51":9.0,"53":35.8077279,"54":7.0,"55":3.0,"56":0.752749086,"57":0.0232809,"58":52.46982227,"60":12.74167721,"61":45.62505104,"62":0.172608753,"63":0.001665935,"67":0.423902007,"68":0.423902007,"71":0.237385124,"72":0.237385124,"73":0.237385124,"210":10.0}},{"appliedStats":{},"appliedTotal":0.0,"externalId":"401128055","id":"01401128055","proTeamId":24,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{}},{"appliedStats":{},"appliedTotal":0.0,"externalId":"401127970","id":"01401127970","proTeamId":24,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{}},{"appliedAverage":0.0,"appliedStats":{},"appliedTotal":0.0,"externalId":"2018","id":"002018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"155":12.0,"156":4.0,"174":0.75,"210":16.0}},{"appliedAverage":8.0,"appliedStats":{"53":2.0,"42":6.0},"appliedTotal":8.0,"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"41":4.0,"42":60.0,"47":12.0,"48":6.0,"49":3.0,"50":2.0,"210":1.0,"51":1.0,"53":4.0,"58":5.0,"59":9.0,"155":1.0,"60":15.0,"61":60.0}}],"universeId":1},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":34,"totalRanking":290,"totalRating":8.0}},"rosterLocked":true,"status":"ONTEAM","tradeLocked":false},"status":"NORMAL"},{"acquisitionDate":1566789842875,"acquisitionType":"DRAFT","injuryStatus":"NORMAL","lineupSlotId":20,"pendingTransactionIds":null,"playerId":3049916,"playerPoolEntry":{"appliedStatTotal":9.8,"id":3049916,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":10,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":6,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":2,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":4,"published":false,"rank":90,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},"PPR":{"auctionValue":4,"published":false,"rank":92,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[2,3,23,7,20,21],"firstName":"Matt","fullName":"Matt Breida","id":3049916,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","lastName":"Breida","lastNewsDate":1569205322000,"lastVideoDate":1545422963000,"outlooks":{"outlooksByWeek":{"1":"Breida earned his shot as the top back in the 49ers offense in 2018 after serving as the backup to Carlos Hyde in 2017 as a rookie. He didn't have anything resembling a breakout campaign, however, so San Francisco brought in Tevin Coleman to supplement their backfield depth chart. That relegates the former undrafted free-agent to a timeshare, but one where he's certain to see at least some of the work early on as Kyle Shanahan scouts out his best offensive options. As such, he's a flex option against a weak Buccaneers squad in Week 1.","2":"Breida played on only 30 snaps in Week 1 and, while he earned 15 carries while on the field, he's obviously a part of a timeshare with Raheem Mostert. Tevin Coleman also figured to play a role, but he'll be sidelined with an ankle injury for a few weeks, which clears up the situation a bit. The Bengals offer a great matchup for running backs, having allowed the most RB fantasy points last season and ceding a pair of touchdowns to Chris Carson in Week 1. All signs point to RB2 status for Breida, but don't be too surprised if he shares time and production with Mostert and Jeff Wilson Jr.","3":"Breida is in a three-way timeshare at running back with Raheem Mostert and Jeff Wilson Jr., but he leads the team in both carries and yards on the ground this season with an impressive 5.9 yards-per-attempt. There are obvious red flags here, with Mostert playing more snaps than Breida in Week 2 and Wilson scoring a pair of touchdowns, so don't bank on Week 2's production all the time, especially in tougher matchups. Week 3 will see the 49ers host the Steelers without Ben Roethlisberger, which could mean opportunities for Breida to run with a favorable game script, but even then he's best viewed as a flex play."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":1.5773993808049536,"averageDraftPosition":121.82362257230974,"percentChange":-4.610024822612843,"percentOwned":81.1973235860757,"percentStarted":5.591193293871559},"proTeamId":25,"rankings":{"0":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":23,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":23,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2}],"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":29,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":29,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":29,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":31,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":29,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":30,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":26,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":31,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":29.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":28.833333333333332,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":30,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":23,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":21,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":23,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":31,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":23,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":34,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":23,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":30,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":25.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":26.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":23,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":32,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":32,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":23,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":22,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":24,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":22,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":26,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":20,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":25.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":24.833333333333332,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":24,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}]},"seasonOutlook":"Breida went undrafted in 2017 but received significant hype leading into his rookie season. He has lived up to it, averaging 5.0 YPC on 258 career carries, including 5.3 YPC in 2018 (seventh-best). Breida stepped up his game as a receiver in 2018, catching 84 percent of his targets (fifth-best) and averaging 8.2 yards per target (third-best) on 32 targets. Breida is on the small side at 5-foot-11, 190 pounds, which has led to a limited role near the goal line (five rushing touchdowns and seven carries inside the 5 in his career). If there's a red flag here, it's Breida's poor post-contact production (career 1.62 YAC). Breida has been effective, but he'll need to share the 49er's backfield with Tevin Coleman in 2019.

option.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":9.429460299142857,"appliedStats":{"53":16.98330062,"101":0.713448,"72":-1.401227982,"24":56.08349209000001,"25":24.276795522,"26":0.178513938,"42":28.52934232,"43":6.541179006,"44":0.073220674,"63":0.03438},"appliedTotal":132.012444188,"externalId":"2018","id":"102018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":134.1243041,"24":560.8349209,"25":4.046132587,"26":0.089256969,"27":112.0,"28":56.0,"29":28.0,"30":22.0,"31":11.0,"32":5.0,"33":26.0,"34":13.0,"35":0.265101981,"36":0.185571387,"37":0.862689199,"38":0.0294,"39":4.181456333833832,"40":37.23385367,"41":33.96660124,"42":285.2934232,"43":1.090196501,"44":0.036610337,"45":0.058239783,"46":0.038059698,"47":57.0,"48":28.0,"49":14.0,"50":11.0,"51":5.0,"52":2.0,"53":33.96660124,"54":6.0,"55":3.0,"56":0.120549107,"57":0.00373,"58":46.28278336,"60":8.399233740938161,"61":18.94064221,"62":0.125867305,"63":0.00573,"66":1.164161763,"67":0.294820679,"68":1.458982442,"70":0.535514411,"71":0.16509958,"72":0.700613991,"73":0.700613991,"101":0.118908,"114":445.905,"210":14.0}},{"appliedAverage":9.877875764,"appliedStats":{"53":12.33108607,"72":-1.43395066,"24":79.63370912,"25":28.531126013999998,"26":0.364806508,"42":21.264429030000002,"43":7.3212781200000006,"44":0.119883456,"63":0.035768802},"appliedTotal":148.16813646,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":170.2294868,"24":796.3370912,"25":4.755187669,"26":0.182403254,"27":159.0,"28":79.0,"29":39.0,"30":31.0,"31":15.0,"33":34.0,"34":17.0,"35":0.343068476,"36":0.240147933,"37":1.748870731,"38":0.0597,"39":4.678020865,"40":52.86885252,"42":212.6442903,"43":1.22021302,"44":0.059941728,"45":0.0718131,"46":0.046929861,"47":42.0,"48":21.0,"49":10.0,"50":8.0,"51":4.0,"53":24.66217214,"54":4.0,"55":2.0,"56":0.079888381,"57":0.002470775,"58":32.73508754,"60":8.622285543,"61":14.11746326,"62":0.242344983,"63":0.005961467,"66":1.324958081,"67":0.191954666,"68":1.516912747,"70":0.609480717,"71":0.107494613,"72":0.71697533,"73":0.71697533,"210":15.0625}},{"appliedStats":{"53":1.0,"24":6.800000000000001,"42":2.0},"appliedTotal":9.8,"externalId":"401127998","id":"01401127998","proTeamId":25,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":14.0,"24":68.0,"27":13.0,"28":6.0,"29":3.0,"30":2.0,"31":1.0,"33":2.0,"34":1.0,"39":4.857,"40":68.0,"41":2.0,"42":20.0,"47":4.0,"48":2.0,"49":1.0,"53":2.0,"58":3.0,"59":16.0,"60":10.0,"61":20.0,"155":1.0,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{},"appliedTotal":0.0,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{}},{"appliedStats":{"53":0.8005895115,"72":-0.1052749,"24":5.396467977,"25":1.4009567760000001,"26":0.01742,"42":1.406792282,"43":0.501445782,"44":0.008335208,"63":0.002628},"appliedTotal":9.4293606365,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":11.68550051,"24":53.96467977,"25":0.233492796,"26":0.00871,"27":10.0,"28":5.0,"29":2.0,"30":2.0,"31":1.0,"33":2.0,"34":1.0,"35":0.0237,"36":0.0166,"37":0.127,"38":0.00435,"39":4.618088863,"40":53.96467977,"42":14.06792282,"43":0.083574297,"44":0.004167604,"45":0.00472466,"46":0.003087565,"47":2.0,"48":1.0,"53":1.601179023,"56":0.005327915,"57":1.65E-4,"58":2.137884357,"60":8.785977468,"61":14.06792282,"62":0.012873667,"63":4.38E-4,"66":0.0981,"67":0.013437836,"68":0.111507971,"70":0.0451,"71":0.007525188,"72":0.05263745,"73":0.05263745,"210":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":8.452824305,"appliedStats":{"53":6.052036285,"72":-1.258073456,"24":69.23387359,"25":21.680642196,"26":0.202350048,"42":10.57182859,"43":3.306497298,"44":0.06583207,"63":0.031729344},"appliedTotal":109.886715965,"externalId":"2019","id":"122019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{"23":149.8151354,"24":692.3387359,"25":3.613440366,"26":0.101175024,"27":138.0,"28":69.0,"29":34.0,"30":27.0,"31":13.0,"33":29.0,"34":14.0,"35":0.304203939,"36":0.212942758,"37":1.622418461,"38":0.055366918,"39":4.621286987,"40":53.25682584,"42":105.7182859,"43":0.551082883,"44":0.032916035,"45":0.059463083,"46":0.038859124,"47":21.0,"48":10.0,"49":5.0,"50":4.0,"51":2.0,"53":12.10407257,"54":2.0,"55":1.0,"56":0.041975168,"57":0.001298201,"58":16.1882518,"60":8.734108728,"61":8.132175836,"62":0.134091059,"63":0.005288224,"66":1.245014997,"67":0.100588981,"68":1.345603978,"70":0.572706899,"71":0.05632983,"72":0.629036728,"73":0.629036728,"210":13.0}},{"appliedAverage":10.642857142857142,"appliedStats":{"53":13.5,"72":-2.0,"24":81.4,"25":18.0,"42":26.1,"43":12.0},"appliedTotal":149.0,"externalId":"2018","id":"002018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":153.0,"24":814.0,"25":3.0,"27":159.0,"28":76.0,"29":3

riches in terms of talent around him on offense, and he's taken advantage of that by delivering a few notable fantasy performances over the past two seasons. However, he lacks the upside of the superstar fantasy quarterbacks and falls squarely in the middle of the second tier, alongside names like Dak Prescott, Matt Ryan and Kirk Cousins. The Panthers allowed the fifth-most passing touchdowns (32) a year ago, making Goff a fringe QB1 pick for Week 1.","2":"Goff averaged only 4.8 yards-per-attempt in Week 1, the second-lowest rate in the league ahead of only New York's Sam Darnold. That is not what we expect from Goff, who had healthy YPA rates of 8.0 and 8.4 in 2017 and 2018.  Likely to have to pass early and often against a good Saints team, Goff is a borderline starting quarterback in fantasy for Week 2, but consider other options if you have them.","3":"Goff and the Rams have won both of their games, but the 24-year-old's fantasy numbers aren't all that impressive. Week 2's win over New Orleans proved how willing Los Angeles is to control the game in order to see out a victory, as the Rams won easily while Goff attempted only 28 passes. It's hard to judge Cleveland's pass defense based on Week 2, when they faced Jets third-stringer Luke Falk, but in Week 1 they ceded 248 yards and three touchdowns to Marcus Mariota. This looks like a good matchup, but Goff isn't guaranteed to have a good game. He's a streaming option if he's available as a pickup in your league, but he's not a set-and-forget starter.","4":"Goff remains just outside the top tier of fantasy quarterbacks, showing promise at times and failing to deliver at others. He's at the helm of one of the best offenses in football, but that doesn't translate into \"video game numbers\" like it does for Patrick Mahomes or Tom Brady. That said, he'll face a Buccaneers defense in Week 4 that's coming off of a poor performance against rookie Daniel Jones, who scored four times in a comeback victory. That makes Goff a premier streaming option if he's on waivers, and a name to consider as a borderline QB1 this week."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":0.7786377708978328,"averageDraftPosition":138.74931221342226,"percentChange":-2.231462571078808,"percentOwned":83.25640545940365,"percentStarted":40.068949463242426},"proTeamId":14,"rankings":{"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":17,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":14.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":15.333333333333334,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":17,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":14.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":13.333333333333334,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":14.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":15.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":9.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":9.166666666666666,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}]},"seasonOutlook":"Goff has flourished during his two seasons with Sean McVay at the helm. The Rams have finished top five in offensive touchdowns and Goff has finished top five in both yards per completion and yards per attempt each of those seasons. Goff was fantasy's No. 12 scoring QB in 2017 and improved to No. 7 in 2018. Goff adds little with his legs as he has only tallied 175 rushing yards in 38 career games. His accuracy remains a question, too, finishing no better than in the 63rd percentile in off-target rate each of his three seasons.

He's joined by former Steeler Jesse James on the TE depth chart, but Hockenson is the one to watch. The Cardinals are fairly stingy when it comes to allowing production to opposing passing games, and particularly so against tight ends, so don't expect much from Hockenson in his debut. Keep him on the bench for now. ","2":"Hockenson had an incredible NFL debut, hauling in six passes for 131 yards and his first professional touchdown. The Iowa product definitely has the trust and attention of QB Matthew Stafford and should have the attention of fantasy managers, as well. Rookie tight ends are usually overrated in fantasy as they rarely produce at a level befitting their draft hype, but there's already hard evidence that Hockenson might break the mold. Consider him a borderline TE1 for what should be a competitive matchup with a Chargers defense that allowed the Colts to score twice via the air in Week 1.","3":"Hockenson wasted no time in establishing himself as a fantasy option at tight end, racking up 131 yards and a score in Week 1. Things came crashing down to earth in Week 2, however, with only three targets thrown his way against the Chargers. His playing time didn't decrease, however, so there's no need to panic. If you bought in after Week 1, there's no reason to ditch him after Week 2. The Eagles allowed Vernon Davis into the end zone in Week 1 and have given up six passing touchdowns so far in 2019. Consider Hockenson to be on the fringe of the TE1 ranks in Week 3.","4":"While Hockenson hasn't yet repeated his huge numbers from Week 1, there are still positives to take away from his play since then. The rookie ranks No. 4 among Lions pass-catchers in both targets and yards, putting him clearly in the picture for production when the Lions take to the air. He's also playing on plenty of snaps, sharing time with Jesse James in 2-TE sets but sitting out only about 25% of the time. So while we can't expect huge performances every week, he's certainly a viable fantasy option. He's worthy of a spot in your lineup in what should be a high-scoring matchup with Kansas City in Week 4."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":0.2801857585139319,"averageDraftPosition":162.57632346811172,"percentChange":-6.682435591958381,"percentOwned":67.43173678701878,"percentStarted":35.38886001324324},"proTeamId":8,"rankings":{"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":21,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":20,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":20,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":20,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":22.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":18.833333333333332,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6}],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":10.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":10.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":10.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":10.333333333333334,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":7.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":8.666666666666666,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6}]},"seasonOutlook":"Detroit selected Hockenson eighth overall in April's draft. The Iowa product joins free-agent signing Jesse James atop the Lions' depth chart. Hockenson is a terrific pass catcher and good blocker who has drawn comparisons to Travis Kelce, Rob Gronkowski and even former Hawkeye George Kittle. Hockenson is a superb athlete, with good size (6-foot-5, 251 pounds) and toughness. He crushed it at the combine, placing near the top of the position in all but the bench press. Hockenson has every-down tight end written all over him, but, as is usual for rookie tight ends, he figures to learn the ropes in 2019 before emerging as a fantasy threat in 2020. Hockenson doesn't need to be on your radar in 10-team leagues in 2019.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":5.619119134562501,"appliedStats":{"53":21.333406555,"72":-0.566593014,"42":47.09428947000001,"43":21.6385923,"44":0.394282038,"63":0.011928804},"appliedTotal":89.90590615300002,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"42":470.9428947,"43":3.60643205,"44":0.197141019,"45":0.127677758,"46":0.083437415,"47":94.0,"48":47.0,"49":23.0,"50":18.0,"51":9.0,"53":42.66681311,"54":8.0,"55":4.0,"56":0.36478443,"57":0.011281993,"58":63.63608309,"60":11.03768621,"61":29.43393092,"62":0.197141019,"63":0.001988134,"67":0.505886619,"68":0.505886619,"71":0.283296507,"72":0.283296507,"73":0.283296507,"210":16.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":1.710087977,"72":-0.045418152,"42":4.304723879,"43":2.123983032,"44":0.037285114,"63":9.54E-4},"appliedTotal":8.13161585,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"42":43.04723879,"43":0.353997172,"44":0.018642557,"45":0.011641094,"46":0.007607455,"47":8.0,"48":4.0,"49":2.0,"50":1.0,"53":3.420175954,"56":0.063989789,"57":0.00198,"58":5.298592858,"60":12.58626438,"61":43.04723879,"62":0.018642557,"63":1.59E-4,"67":0.040551921,"68":0.040551921,"71":0.022709076,"72":0.022709076,"73":0.022709076,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":1.7350971435,"72":-0.04608237,"42":4.349606785000001,"43":1.268003376,"44":0.02234204,"63":9.72E-4},"appliedTotal":7.329938974500001,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"42":43.49606785,"43":0.211333896,"44":0.01117102,"45":0.011883507,"46":0.007765872,"47":8.0,"48":4.0,"49":2.0,"50":1.0,"53":3.470194287,"56":0.065847968,"57":0.00204,"58":5.326756862,"60":12.53418807,"61":43.49606785,"62":0.01117102,"63":1.62E-4,"67":0.041144973,"68":0.041144973,"71":0.023041185,"72":0.023041185,"73":0.023041185,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":0.5,"42":0.1},"appliedTotal":0.6,"externalId":"401127959","id":"01401127959","proTeamId":8,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"41":1.0,"42":1.0,"53":1.0,"58":4.0,"59":2.0,"60":1.0,"61":1.0,"155":1.0,"210":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":6.986308222307691,"appliedStats":{"53":20.03683074,"72":-0.532157314,"42":50.45473507,"43":20.487987972,"44":0.36340661,"63":0.011203812},"appliedTotal":90.82200688999998,"externalId":"2019","id":"122019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{"42":504.5473507,"43":3.414664662,"44":0.181703305,"45":0.145894359,"46":0.095341963,"47":100.0,"48":50.0,"49":25.0,"50":20.0,"51":10.0,"53":40.07366148,"54":8.0,"55":4.0,"56":0.627967912,"57":0.019421688,"58":62.73710825,"60":12.5904979,"61":38.81133467,"62":0.181703305,"63":0.001867302,"67":0.475140458,"68":0.475140458,"71":0.266078657,"72":0.266078657,"73":0.266078657,"210":13.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":1.5,"42":2.7,"43":6.0},"appliedTotal":10.2,"externalId":"401128023","id":"01401128023","proTeamId":8,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"41":3.0,"42":27.0,"43":1.0,"47":5.0,"48":2.0,"49":1.0,"210":1.0,"50":1.0,"53":3.0,"183":1.0,"58":3.0,"59":22.0,"60":9.0,"156":1.0,"61":27.0,"158":6.0}},{"appliedAverage":7.966666666666666,"appliedStats":{"53":4.0,"42":13.9,"43":6.0},"appliedTotal":23.9,"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"41":8.0,"42":139.0,"43":1.0,"47":27.0,"48":13.0,"49":6.0,"210":3.0,"50":5.0,"51":2.0,"52":1.0,"53":8.0,"54":1.0,"56":1.0,"185":1.0,"58":16.0,"59":56.0,"155":2.0,"60":17.375,"61":46.33333333,"158":6.0}}],"universeId":2},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":15,"totalRanking":159,"totalRating":23.9}},"rosterLocked":true,"status":"ONTEAM","tradeLocked":false},"status":"NORMAL"},{"acquisitionDate":1568187019988,"acquisitionType":"ADD","injuryStatus":"NORMAL","lineupSlotId":20,"pendingTransactionIds":null,"playerId":16804,"playerPoolEntry":{"appliedStatTotal":16.9,"id":16804,"keeperValue":7,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":true,"onTeamId":6,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":3,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":2,"published":false,"rank":149,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},"PPR":{"auctionValue":2,"published":false,"rank":152,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[3,4,5,23,7,20,21],"firstName":"John","fullName":"John Brown","id":16804,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","lastName":"Brown","lastNewsDate":1569794284000,"lastVideoDate":1568052593000,"outlooks":{"outlooksByWeek":{"1":"Our projections deem Brown a fringe fantasy option for his debut with the Bills. The upside? The Jets allowed the most yards to receivers among AFC teams last year, and Josh Allen has a big arm and a penchant for taking risks. Brown is a vertical threat, but it's wise to let him first earn a starting fantasy role.","2":"An awesome Week 1 saw Brown lead the Bills in targets, air yards, yards and receptions. Brown also scored a touchdown and should be considered a strong flex candidate against a Giants defense that has allowed the fifth-most receiving yards to wideouts since the start of last season.","3":"Brown is 12th in the league with a 28.6% target share of Buffalo's passing offense, aligned with the usage rates we find for Odell Beckham and T.Y. Hilton this season. With plenty of opportunities to produce, and many of them valuable downfield chances, Brown is a solid flex option facing a Bengals pass defense that has allowed the 10th-most yards to wideouts dating to the start of last season.","4":"With his average target traveling 13 air yards, it's not surprising to see Brown netting 13.7 yards per reception this season. Brown, who is tied for the team lead in targets with Cole Beasley, gets a big share of Buffalo's high-leverage vertical work. He's still in the flex discussion against a stingy New England secondary for Week 4."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":0.6718266253869969,"averageDraftPosition":153.02850237519795,"percentChange":-2.2813735455801094,"percentOwned":58.68738679213042,"percentStarted":12.354467367653593},"proTeamId":2,"rankings":{"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":45,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":45,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":44,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":48,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":48,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":47.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":49.333333333333336,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":38,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":38,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":39,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":38,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":35,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":29,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":36,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":33,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":41,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":31,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":38.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":37.666666666666664,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":40,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":40,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":45,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":40,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":40,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":42,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":40,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":41,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":39,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":29,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":40.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":39.166666666666664,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":31,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":38,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":34,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":38,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":67,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":34,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":34,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":35,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":34,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":67,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":33,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":67,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":36,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":34.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":35.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":67,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23}]},"seasonOutlook":"Brown signed with the Bills after spending the first five seasons of his career in Arizona and Baltimore. Brown's best season saw him post a 65/1,003/7 line in 2015. He was fantasy's No. 25-scoring receiver that season, but he has been unable to come close to that production since. A sickle trait issue cost Brown game action during his stint in Arizona, but with that behind him, the 29-year-old didn't miss a single game en route to a 42/717/5 line last season. Brown's 14.9 average depth of target is highest in the NFL among 41 players with 400-plus targets since he entered the league.

Monday practice but, barring a wild turn of events, looks like he'll be ready for Week 1 against the Rams. He played in just nine games in 2018 after suiting up for just seven the year before, but he's been a bit ignored this fantasy draft season. Carolina will probably have to utilize him frequently against the Rams, giving him a decent shot at TE1 fantasy production in Week 1.","2":"Olsen caught four passes in Week 1 but ended up with a back injury. The short turn-around before a Thursday night game jeopardizes his availability for Week 2 against the Buccaneers, in which case Ian Thomas would receive a bump in offensive attention. If you need a logical handcuff for the week, feel free to pick up Thomas.","3":"Olsen convinced us he was over his back issue by showing up strong in Week 2. He may remain busy in Week 3 against the Cardinals, who are without suspended CB Patrick Peterson, but that's because Carolina has its own major problem -- QB Cam Newton (foot) is uncertain to play. Kyle Allen or Will Grier may fill in and probably would lean on Olsen in that case, giving the veteran tight end a strong case to start in many fantasy TE slots Sunday.","4":"Olsen tore apart Arizona's Patrick Peterson-less defense with a 6-75-2 line in Week 3. He's an optimal pickup for any fantasy manager needing a bye-week replacement. The switch from Cam Newton (foot) to Kyle Allen hasn't tripped him up, eithe. He's had seven-plus targets in every game this year and looks to be at the healthiest we've seen him in recent years. Houston has allowed just 90 receiving yards to tight ends this year but hasn't faced one as heavily involved as Olsen. He's a safe fantasy starter as long as Allen is under center."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":0.7414860681114551,"averageDraftPosition":138.85208333333333,"percentChange":12.653446807096628,"percentOwned":86.66601635926588,"percentStarted":56.41070187630299},"proTeamId":29,"rankings":{"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":14.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":14.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6}],"2":[],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":6.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":8.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":5.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":6.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6}]},"seasonOutlook":"Injuries have derailed Olsen's past two seasons, limiting the veteran tight end to 44 catches for 482 yards and five touchdowns in 16 games during that span. Olsen played a majority of the snaps in seven games last season and was fantasy's No. 8 scoring tight end. Olsen's slump came after he ranked no lower than second at the position in snaps in five consecutive seasons, finishing each as a top-seven fantasy tight end. Olsen is expected back for Week 1 and should be no lower than third on the team in targets behind Christian McCaffrey and DJ Moore. Olsen is no spring chicken at 34 years old, but he's an obvious rebound candidate and can be had at a major discount late in drafts.

preseason doesn’t necessarily mean Washington will see the field much to begin the regular campaign. Behind Donte Moncrief for meaningful snaps on the outside, Washington is for now a promising bench stash for this meeting with the Patriots.","2":"Serving a specialist role as a vertical threat for the Steelers in Week 1, Washington netted a team-high 27.5 air yards per target, albeit on just two looks. Without a sizable role just yet, Washington remains a sleeper stash ideal for deeper leagues.","3":"Washington enjoyed a strong rapport with Mason Rudolph in the preseason that could eventually convert into regular season production. While Washington could be a rising option in the passing game, he's not above Donte Moncrief yet on the depth chart and thus isn't worth starting in lineups against a 49ers defense that has been generous to wideouts thus far.","4":"We didn't see the awesome preseason rapport Washington had with Mason Rudolph surface in San Francisco, but there is at least some long-term upside to this pairing. The Bengals have allowed nearly 15 yards per catch to wideouts, but we'll want to see Washington prove it on the field before rolling him out in lineups."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":0.7987616099071208,"averageDraftPosition":146.8371259481537,"percentChange":-10.905407544282177,"percentOwned":40.76211130991753,"percentStarted":2.0781876449366425},"proTeamId":23,"rankings":{"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":48,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":48,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":47,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":45,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":50,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":50,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":49.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":49.166666666666664,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":48,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":50.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":45,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":44,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":48.833333333333336,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}]},"seasonOutlook":"The Steelers have a lengthy resume of developing wide receivers into stars, and Washington could be next. The 2018 second-round pick underwhelmed as a rookie, but he was an explosive downfield playmaker at Oklahoma State and last preseason. With Antonio Brown gone, Washington will compete with Donte Moncrief and rookie Diontae Johnson for No. 2 duties opposite JuJu Smith-Schuster in an offense that set a franchise record for touchdowns last season. Washington, whose vertical role yielded a 16.2 aDOT on 37 targets last season, has WR2 upside if he's able to carve out an every-down role in his second season.

back with the team for the past few weeks, Gordon could play a limited role in this matchup with the Steelers, a team that struggled with big-play receivers in 2018. It's likely best to stash Gordon for now and see how his usage and production play out from the bench, but there is enough fantasy upside in this potential shootout with the Steelers to support flex value for the gifted wideout.","2":"Third on the team in routes in Week 1 and with a solid 14 air yards per target in returning to action this past Sunday, Gordon is a fine WR3 prospect heading into a choice matchup with the Dolphins' feeble back seven. There is some risk in using Gordon given the presence of target hog Antonio Brown, but there's still a lot to like about Gordon's role going forward.","3":"A quiet Week 2 saw Gordon finish second on the team in routes but a lack of efficiency left him with just two catches on the afternoon. There will be some natural variance to Gordon's role given the sheer talent and depth on this offense, but he's still in the starting flex discussion in deeper leagues given his playmaking upside against a mistake-prone Jets secondary.","4":"With Julian Edelman leaving the field in the second quarter with an injury, Gordon led the Patriots in routes and targets in Week 3. The Bills have a strong defense overall, but have allowed the third-most catches to receivers so far, setting up Gordon as a solid starting option in Orchard Park."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":6.362229102167182,"averageDraftPosition":86.56973837693718,"percentChange":2.0087222982737387,"percentOwned":92.63061667359644,"percentStarted":46.628002346628996},"proTeamId":17,"rankings":{"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":28,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":29,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":31,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":32,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":22,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":34,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":24,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":30,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":33,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":29,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":27.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":30.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":27,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":23,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":30,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":23,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":27,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":17,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":27,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":33,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":34,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":24.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":28.833333333333332,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":30,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":35,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":27,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":33,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":27,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":30,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":31,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":26,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":24,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":29.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":27.333333333333332,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":20,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":24,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":26,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":24,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":51,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":21,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":23,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":17,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":51,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":24,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":51,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":30,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":20.5,"publish

was reinstated in August and will rejoin the Patriots this season. The 28-year-old wide receiver wasn't nearly as dominant last season as he was back at his peak in 2013, but was still very effective, ranking sixth among wide receivers in ypr (18.0), 10th in ypt (10.2) and fourth in RAC (6.7). Gordon was often utilized as a vertical threat (13.8 aDOT), which limited his volume a bit; during the nine full games he played, Gordon (63) was behind both Julian Edelman (83) and James White (70) in targets. Gordon ranked 24th in fantasy points during those nine weeks. He's back in the WR3 discussion, but his off-field troubles make him a risky early-round

release could see Singletary, in his professional debut, lead Buffalo’s backfield in touches. However, the presence of two veterans, Frank Gore and T.J. Yeldon, will limit Singletary's workload. He is a risky flex play against a Jets defense that allowed the 10th-fewest yards before contact per rush last season.","2":"We're guessing Singletary won't always make so much of four attempts—he netted 17.5 yards per carry in Week 1—but it was impressive to see the rookie's big-play potential realized against the Jets. He also had a big receiving role, which bodes well for his potential as a flex option in Week 2 against a Giants front seven that could struggle to cover him in space.","3":"Hopefully Singletary can overcome a hamstring ailment and suit up for Week 3's matchup with Cincinnati's soft rush defense. After all, this exciting rookie has averaged an awesome 12.7 yards per rush this season. If Singletary ever grabs a bigger share of Buffalo's backfield workload, he could emerge as a fantasy star.  For now, he's a solid flex with realistic upside given the opponent.","4":"A big-play maven averaging a ridiculous 12.7 yards per rushing attempt through two appearances, Singletary's hamstring issue and the presence of Frank Gore curb any potential enthusiasm. In addition, the Bill will face a Patriots defense allowing the fewest yards per attempt to running backs.

Singletary is very undersized (5-foot-7, 203 pounds) and lacks home run speed (4.66 40-yard dash), but makes up for that with toughness and elusiveness. The Florida Atlantic star ran for 22 touchdowns and ranked among the top backs in the class in broken tackle rate and evaded tackle rate in 2018. Singletary can contribute as a receiver and is a strong pass-blocker. Following the offseason release of LeSean McCoy, the rookie is positioned for a big role ahead of Frank Gore and TJ Yeldon. Take a shot on Singletary in the middle rounds.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":10.292857668,"appliedStats":{"53":15.68149212,"101":0.013989174,"72":-1.921012166,"24":81.70633831,"25":26.536060452,"26":0.257249452,"42":26.571157190000005,"43":5.392773078,"44":0.107095954,"63":0.047721456},"appliedTotal":154.39286502,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":183.4119475,"24":817.0633831,"25":4.422676742,"26":0.128624726,"27":163.0,"28":81.0,"29":40.0,"30":32.0,"31":16.0,"33":36.0,"34":18.0,"35":0.372277868,"36":0.260594507,"37":1.843669427,"38":0.062917364,"39":4.454799124,"40":54.24487191,"42":265.7115719,"43":0.898795513,"44":0.053547977,"45":0.063402049,"46":0.041433239,"47":53.0,"48":26.0,"49":13.0,"50":10.0,"51":5.0,"53":31.36298424,"54":6.0,"55":3.0,"56":0.107465033,"57":0.003323661,"58":42.20242456,"60":8.472139316,"61":17.64060228,"62":0.182172704,"63":0.007953576,"66":1.728279301,"67":0.295531437,"68":2.023810738,"70":0.795008478,"71":0.165497605,"72":0.960506083,"73":0.960506083,"101":0.002331529,"114":8.743235294,"210":15.0625}},{"appliedStats":{},"appliedTotal":0.0,"externalId":"401127866","id":"01401127866","proTeamId":2,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{}},{"appliedStats":{},"appliedTotal":0.0,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{}},{"appliedStats":{},"appliedTotal":0.0,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{}},{"appliedStats":{},"appliedTotal":0.0,"externalId":"401127915","id":"01401127915","proTeamId":2,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{}},{"appliedAverage":7.770818160666667,"appliedStats":{"53":15.11807313,"72":-1.000790074,"24":32.960426080000005,"25":15.583948932,"26":0.131350798,"42":24.816169990000002,"43":5.495523852,"44":0.120925026,"63":0.024190193999999998},"appliedTotal":93.249817928,"externalId":"2019","id":"122019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{"23":78.63411116,"24":329.6042608,"25":2.597324822,"26":0.065675399,"27":65.0,"28":32.0,"29":16.0,"30":13.0,"31":6.0,"33":15.0,"34":7.0,"35":0.153059182,"36":0.107141427,"37":0.401285822,"38":0.013694346,"39":4.191619335,"40":27.46702173,"42":248.1616999,"43":0.915920642,"44":0.060462513,"45":0.048134978,"46":0.031456208,"47":49.0,"48":24.0,"49":12.0,"50":9.0,"51":4.0,"53":30.23614626,"54":6.0,"55":3.0,"56":0.119376656,"57":0.003692062,"58":39.30531974,"60":8.207451366,"61":20.68014166,"62":0.126137912,"63":0.004031699,"66":0.740964307,"67":0.284913314,"68":1.025877621,"70":0.340843581,"71":0.159551456,"72":0.500395037,"73":0.500395037,"210":12.0}},{"appliedAverage":12.000000000000002,"appliedStats":{"53":2.5,"24":12.700000000000001,"25":6.0,"42":2.8000000000000003},"appliedTotal":24.000000000000004,"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"210":2.0,"23":10.0,"24":127.0,"25":1.0,"27":25.0,"155":2.0,"28":12.0,"29":5.0,"30":4.0,"158":6.0,"31":2.0,"33":1.0,"39":12.7,"40":63.5,"41":5.0,"42":28.0,"47":5.0,"48":2.0,"49":1.0,"50":1.0,"180":1.0,"53":5.0,"54":1.0,"58":6.0,"59":34.0,"60":5.6,"61":14.0}}],"universeId":1},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":36,"totalRanking":157,"totalRating":24.0}},"rosterLocked":true,"status":"ONTEAM","tradeLocked":false},"status":"NORMAL"},{"acquisitionDate":1569412394527,"acquisitionType":"ADD","injuryStatus":"NORMAL","lineupSlotId":16,"pendingTransactionIds":null,"playerId":-16023,"playerPoolEntry":{"appliedStatTotal":8.0,"id":-16023,"keeperValue":17,"keeperValueFuture":0,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":6,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":16,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":317,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},"PPR":{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":317,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[16,20,21],"firstName":"Steelers","fullName":"Steelers D/ST","id":-16023,"injured":false,"lastName":"D/ST","outlooks":{"outlooksByWeek":{"1":"The Steelers have led the league in sacks the past two years, which is often a strong indicator of fantasy production. The Patriots, however, allowed one of the lower pressure rates in football last season and with a lofty point total in place for this prime-time matchup, it's likely wise to avoid this group until the schedule improves.","2":"New England had their way with the Steelers' defense in week one, resulting in a negative fantasy performance for Pittsburgh. The Seahawks aren't quite the dynamic threat the Patriots pose, but they do enter town with a star quarterback and solid playmakers, revealing some risk in streaming this Steelers' D/ST in Week 2.","3":"Pittsburgh's injured and underwhelming offense has gotten the attention through two weeks, but it's worth noting the Steelers have allowed the fifth-most yards per dropback to opponents. To be fair, those two opponents were Tom Brady and Russell Wilson. This week presents the Steelers with a challenge against a 49ers offense seemingly finding its fitting. There is a correlation between being sizable road underdogs and poor fantasy production for defenses, adding some risk to Pittsburgh's profile this week.","4":"The Steelers produced five takeaways in Week 4, but failed to capitalize on offense. It was encouraging at least to see this defense thrive in the big-play department, especially with new import Minkah Fitzpatrick producing. The Bengals enter with some of the higher interception and sack rates per dropback in the league, setting up this Pittsburgh D/ST with solid streaming

it or not, the Steelers have led the NFL in sacks the past two seasons. They generated 52 last season to go with 99 tackles for loss (eighth-most) while allowing 5.3 yards per play (sixth-best) and blocking three kicks (second-most). Pittsburgh's D/ST salvaged an eighth-place fantasy season despite ranking 29th in forced turnovers (15), its lowest total since 2011 (15). Following minimal offseason turnover, Pittsburgh remains outstanding up front with T.J. Watt, Cameron Heyward, Stephon Tuitt and Javon Hargrave leading the way. The unit is suspect beyond that, though LB Devin Bush was scooped up in the first round of the draft, and Steven Nelson is an underrated addition at corner. This is a mid-pack D/ST option in 2019, though a Week 1 trip to New England hurts the draft appeal.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":5.838726282375001,"appliedStats":{"96":13.741035438,"97":2.98170256,"98":0.708461092,"99":38.24375974,"101":0.772902,"102":3.4613903280000002,"103":6.413635193999999,"104":5.275760741999999,"93":0.7996682640000001,"95":21.02130516},"appliedTotal":93.41962051800002,"externalId":"2018","id":"102018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"93":0.133278044,"94":1.9482326559999998,"95":10.51065258,"96":6.870517719,"97":1.49085128,"98":0.354230546,"99":38.24375974,"100":76.0,"101":0.128817,"102":0.576898388,"103":1.068939199,"104":0.879293457,"105":2.787226088,"106":10.57002726,"112":65.92387152,"113":74.17007835,"114":800.9775,"115":287.7614975,"120":356.054324,"122":16.0,"126":22.25339525,"127":5583.338493,"131":16.0,"137":348.9586558,"160":-356.054324,"210":16.0}},{"appliedAverage":6.016060913875,"appliedStats":{"96":16.321992364,"97":1.508758762,"98":0.65009734,"99":46.75395737,"132":-8.0,"101":0.772902,"102":2.566486578,"103":8.042095836,"104":4.36525353,"123":-1.0,"92":1.0,"93":0.7634168219999999,"95":22.51201402},"appliedTotal":96.256974622,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"92":1.0,"93":0.127236137,"94":2.067891561,"95":11.25600701,"96":8.160996182,"97":0.754379381,"98":0.32504867,"99":46.75395737,"100":93.50791475,"101":0.128817,"102":0.427747763,"103":1.340349306,"104":0.727542255,"105":2.75169246,"106":12.55537874,"109":896.4649085,"110":298.0,"111":179.0,"113":73.88626342,"114":739.7496667,"115":275.2671186,"116":73.0,"117":29.0,"118":27.0,"119":11.0,"120":355.2820877,"121":3.0,"122":11.0,"123":1.0,"126":22.20513048,"127":5616.484718,"131":8.0,"132":8.0,"137":351.0302949,"160":-355.2820877,"210":16.0}},{"appliedStats":{"96":6.0,"128":0.0,"129":0.0,"130":0.0,"99":1.0,"132":0.0,"133":-3.0,"134":0.0,"135":0.0,"136":0.0,"89":0.0,"90":0.0,"123":0.0,"91":0.0,"92":0.0,"124":0.0,"95":4.0},"appliedTotal":8.0,"externalId":"401127998","id":"01401127998","proTeamId":23,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"89":0.0,"90":0.0,"91":0.0,"92":0.0,"95":2.0,"96":3.0,"99":1.0,"100":2.0,"106":1.0,"107":12.0,"108":64.0,"109":76.0,"110":25.0,"111":15.0,"112":2.0,"113":5.0,"114":42.0,"116":4.0,"117":1.0,"120":24.0,"121":0.0,"122":1.0,"123":0.0,"124":0.0,"127":436.0,"128":0.0,"129":0.0,"130":0.0,"131":0.0,"132":0.0,"133":1.0,"134":0.0,"135":0.0,"136":0.0,"156":1.0,"187":24.0,"188":0.0,"189":0.0,"190":0.0,"191":0.0,"192":0.0,"193":1.0,"194":0.0,"195":0.0,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"96":0.978801412,"97":0.0945152,"98":0.039945524,"99":3.287211695,"132":-1.0,"101":0.070452,"102":0.15709908,"103":0.49663488,"104":0.27528192,"93":0.04701888,"95":1.57411336},"appliedTotal":6.021073951,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"93":0.00783648,"94":0.1286528,"95":0.78705668,"96":0.489400706,"97":0.0472576,"98":0.019972762,"99":3.287211695,"100":6.574423389,"101":0.011742,"102":0.02618318,"103":0.08277248,"104":0.04588032,"105":0.17441446,"106":0.752924163,"109":56.39230916,"110":18.0,"111":11.0,"113":4.377753806,"114":46.31321429,"115":16.60508197,"116":4.0,"117":1.0,"118":1.0,"120":18.84060705,"121":1.0,"126":18.84060705,"127":361.1938822,"132":1.0,"137":361.1938822,"160":-18.84060705,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"96":0.997112378,"97":0.0930384,"98":0.039321374,"99":2.379449993,"132":-1.0,"101":0.03708,"102":0.158404002,"103":0.48809628,"104":0.27129815999999995,"93":0.04628421,"95":1.243366006},"appliedTotal":4.753450803,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"93":0.007714035,"94":0.12656574,"95":0.621683003,"96":0.498556189,"97":0.0465192,"98":0.019660687,"99":2.379449993,"100":4.758899987,"101":0.00618,"102":0.026400667,"103":0.08134938,"104":0.04521636,"105":0.166860442,"106":0.767009521,"109":55.67450946,"110":18.0,"111":11.0,"113":4.166254063,"114":45.98214286,"115":16.88183333,"116":4.0,"117":1.0,"118":1.0,"120":22.34842615,"122":1.0,"126":22.34842615,"127":360.3010943,"132":1.0,"137":360.3010943,"160":-22.34842615,"210":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":7.785415404461538,"appliedStats":{"96":15.648331036,"128":15.0,"97":1.5403024,"98":0.650987196,"130":2.0,"99":39.45811233,"132":-9.0,"101":0.917821128,"102":2.0506265519999998,"103":8.09359656,"104":4.4862350399999995,"123":-1.0,"92":1.0,"93":0.76626081,"95":19.598127206},"appliedTotal":101.21040025799999,"externalId":"2019","id":"122019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{"92":1.0,"93":0.127710135,"94":2.0966386,"95":9.799063603,"96":7.824165518,"97":0.7701512,"98":0.325493598,"99":39.45811233,"100":78.91622466,"101":0.152970188,"102":0.341771092,"103":1.34893276,"104":0.74770584,"105":2.719090015,"106":12.03717772

opponents for a 1,042-yard rushing mark in 2018, his age-33 season. He'll now have to share carriers with the healthy Derrius Guice, though, in addition to Chris Thompson for pass-catching duties. Peterson deserves a fantasy roster spot, but most weeks is best used as a flex play. Consider him in that capacity against the tough Eagles defense. The holdout of LT Trent Williams could affect the Washington run game for much of the season.","2":"Peterson was scratched due to a coach's decision in Week 1, but Derrius Guice is dealing with a meniscus issue in his knee and expected to miss at least one week. Peterson should be active in Week 2 and for however long Guice sits. Dallas ranked in the middle of the pack in fantasy RB defense last year (24.0 PPR points per game), which doesn't do much to force Peterson's fantasy value any lower than a flex play.","3":"Derrius Guice (knee) was placed on injured reserve before Week 2, giving Peterson the keys to between-the-tackles work at least through the Week 10 bye. He's going to split plenty of work with pass-catching back Chris Thompson, though. In fact, Thompson looks like the better play against the strong Bears defense, due to his penchant for reeling in short tosses. Peterson is a mere flex play with a low floor for Week 3.","4":"Peterson averaged just 3.1 YPC in Week 3 against a tough Bears defense while splitting work again with receiving threat Chris Thompson. The Giants await with a friendlier matchup in Week 4, though. Wendell Smallwood may eat into Peterson's already limited ceiling, unfortunately, keeping him in mere flex territory this weekend."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":0.13003095975232198,"averageDraftPosition":165.45077936150705,"percentChange":-5.159528342219581,"percentOwned":60.61618575138977,"percentStarted":20.586467921261278},"proTeamId":28,"rankings":{"0":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":28,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":31,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2}],"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":41,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":44,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":48.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":49.833333333333336,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2}],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":32,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":26,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":32,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":24,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":31,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":36,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":32,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":26.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":30.333333333333332,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":24,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":35,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":32,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":35,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":27,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":34,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":34,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":26,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":35,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":41,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":29.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":35.166666666666664,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":30,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":27,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":28,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":27,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":29,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":29,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":32,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":23,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":29,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":28,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":27.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":28.833333333333332,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":41,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":31,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}]},"seasonOutlook":"Peterson's 2018 prospects seemed dim during most of last offseason, but Derrius Guice's torn ACL allowed the former fantasy star one more shot at lead back duties. Peterson held down the fort, finishing fifth in the league with 251 carries and averaging 4.2 yards per carry. As usual, Peterson played a minimal role as a receiver (26 targets) but scored enough touchdowns (eight) to manage a 19th-place finish in fantasy points. Peterson re-signed with Washington, but with Guice healthy and ready to roll, the 2018 second-round pick will be the team's primary back. The 34-year-old Peterson will have flex value only if Guice misses time.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":8.382916260687502,"appliedStats":{"53":8.358695665,"72":-2.810857358,"24":79.35410556000001,"25":33.448259016,"26":0.248,"42":12.529346570000001,"43":2.902986666,"44":0.025324052,"63":0.0708},"appliedTotal":134.12666017100003,"externalId":"2018","id":"102018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":200.2818706,"24":793.5410556,"25":5.574709836,"26":0.124,"27":158.0,"28":79.0,"29":39.0,"30":31.0,"31":15.0,"32":7.0,"33":40.0,"34":20.0,"35":0.409965893,"36":0.286976125,"37":1.73,"38":0.059,"39":3.9621212505292034,"40":52.68322361,"41":16.71739133,"42":125.2934657,"43":0.483831111,"44":0.012662026,"45":0.044256061,"46":0.028921336,"47":25.0,"48":12.0,"49":6.0,"50":5.0,"51":2.0,"52":1.0,"53":16.71739133,"54":3.0,"55":1.0,"56":0.050234871,"57":0.00155,"58":21.84866997,"60":7.494797676665979,"61":8.318238384,"62":0.136580764,"63":0.0118,"66":2.773455543,"67":0.231498445,"68":3.004953989,"70":1.27578955,"71":0.129639129,"72":1.405428679,"73":1.405428679,"210":16.0}},{"appliedAverage":3.652434214400001,"appliedStats":{"53":3.355833153,"72":-0.99159611,"24":33.53015304,"25":12.442955364,"26":0.14452166,"42":5.233049921,"43":1.028407344,"44":0.018187408,"63":0.025001436},"appliedTotal":54.78651321600001,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":81.48523574,"24":335.3015304,"25":2.073825894,"26":0.07226083,"27":67.0,"28":33.0,"29":16.0,"30":13.0,"31":6.0,"33":16.0,"34":8.0,"35":0.156717288,"36":0.109702101,"37":0.316551904,"38":0.010802702,"39":4.114874644,"40":22.26068251,"42":52.33049921,"43":0.171401224,"44":0.009093704,"45":0.055486464,"46":0.036260405,"47":10.0,"48":5.0,"49":2.0,"50":2.0,"51":1.0,"53":6.711666306,"54":1.0,"56":0.025690746,"57":7.94559E-4,"58":8.638309459,"60":7.796945917,"61":3.474224014,"62":0.081354534,"63":0.004166906,"66":0.979595425,"67":0.080685998,"68":1.060281423,"70":0.450613895,"71":0.045184159,"72":0.495798055,"73":0.495798055,"210":15.0625}},{"appliedStats":{"53":0.9553965385,"72":-0.203834392,"24":5.232832525,"25":2.723037084,"26":0.039,"42":1.5746645160000001,"43":0.5306498040000001,"44":0.008042262,"63":0.0050880000000000005},"appliedTotal":10.8648763375,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":13.56910539,"24":52.32832525,"25":0.453839514,"26":0.0195,"27":10.0,"28":5.0,"29":2.0,"30":2.0,"31":1.0,"33":2.0,"34":1.0,"35":0.028,"36":0.0196,"37":0.12,"38":0.00409,"39":3.856431484,"40":52.32832525,"42":15.74664516,"43":0.088441634,"44":0.004021131,"45":0.003780391,"46":0.002470486,"47":3.0,"48":1.0,"53":1.910793077,"56":0.006183909,"57":1.91255E-4,"58":2.520606161,"60":8.240895026,"61":15.74664516,"62":0.023480271,"63":8.48E-4,"66":0.189,"67":0.026633907,"68":0.215769142,"70":0.087,"71":0.014914988,"72":0.101917196,"73":0.101917196,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":0.560376364,"72":-0.183819606,"24":4.950652117000001,"25":1.7878682339999998,"26":0.024776874,"42":0.8376225903000001,"43":0.178023792,"44":0.00287761,"63":0.004630428},"appliedTotal":8.163008403300001,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":12.81587561,"24":49.50652117,"25":0.297978039,"26":0.012388437,"27":9.0,"28":4.0,"29":2.0,"30":1.0,"33":2.0,"34":1.0,"35":0.026289067,"36":0.018402347,"37":0.107149416,"38":0.003656598,"39":3.862905873,"40":49.50652117,"42":8.376225903,"43":0.029670632,"44":0.001438805,"45":0.002692774,"46":0.001759728,"47":1.0,"53":1.120752728,"56":0.00330084,"57":1.02088E-4,"58":1.462932634,"60":7.473750179,"61":8.376225903,"62":0.013827243,"63":7.71738E-4,"66":0.180579223,"67":0.015791715,"68":0.196370938,"70":0.083066443,"71":0.00884336,"72":0.091909803,"73":0.091909803,"210":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":5.211464611384614,"appliedStats":{"53":6.084197125,"72":-1.35411042,"24":34.90363622,"25":15.800304462,"26":0.223593074,"42":9.394757781000001,"43":2.622195264,"44":0.040629442,"63":0.033837000000000006},"appliedTotal":67.74903994799999,"externalId":"2019","id":"122019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{"23":90.78170896,"24":349.0363622,"25":2.633384077,"26":0.111796537,"27":69.0,"28":34.0,"29":17.0,"30":13.0,"31":6.0,"33":18.0,"34":9.0,"35":0.184226735,"36":0.128958715,"37":0.679538636,"38":0.023190047,"39":3.844787305,"40":26.84895094,"42":93.94757781,"43":0.437032544,"44":0.020314721,"45":0.037933809,"46":0.024789744,"47":18.0,"48":9.0,"49":4.0,"50":3.0,"51":1.0,"53":12.16839425,"54":2.0,"55":1.0,"56":0.037748482,"57":0.001167479,"58":16.10120975,"60":7.720622448,"61":7.226736755,"62":0.132111258,"63":0.0056395,"66":1.265375964,"67":0.169611189,"68":1.434987154,"70":0.582072944,"71":0.094982266,"72":0.67705521,"73":0.67705521,"210":13.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":0.5,"24":

from the team while holding out for a new contract. Barring any news that'll quickly change his availability for Week 1, he's unlikely to suit up for the opener. Tony Pollard will likely lead a backfield committee in his place. If Elliott signs and somehow starts in the opener, go ahead and roll him back out as a fantasy RB1. Your likelier course of action is to leave him on your bench for Dallas' first 2019 outing against the Giants.","2":"Elliott wasted little time paying off on his new extension, rumbling into the end zone in the Cowboys' opening blowout victory. He only touched the ball 14 times, but Dallas was comfortable with resting him in an easy win during his first NFL action of the season after the long layoff. The star back should be a bit busier as he gets his footing under him for Week 2 against Washington, against whom he averaged 92.5 scrimmage yards and scored twice over two meetings last year. He remains squarely in the RB1 fantasy tier.","3":"Elliott got tons of carries in Week 2, regaining his workhorse workload after being eased into Week 1 following his holdout. Against a wilting Dolphins defense that just traded safety Minkah Fitzpatrick, Elliott shouldn't have trouble reaching the second level. Elliott remains a star fantasy RB1 for Week 3.","4":"Elliott is averaging 5.3 YPC this year, topped off by a 139-yard day from scrimmage in a Week 3 obliteration of the Dolphins. The Saints rank among the strongest fantasy defenses against running backs so far, but haven't faced a back of Elliott's quality yet. Elliott again ranks among the top fantasy RB1s heading into Week 4 thanks to his busy workload. He should get plenty of second-half yardage should New Orleans fail to move the ball without QB Drew Brees

absolute workhorse since entering the NFL in 2016, Elliott has played just under 90 percent of Dallas' snaps and handled over 80 percent of the carries when active over the past two seasons. That's led to a league-high 868 carries despite Elliott having missed eight games during that span. Elliott's game reached a new level last season as he easily reached career highs in targets (94), receptions (77) and receiving yards (567). Elliott led all backs in touches (381) and was second in scrimmage yards (2,001). His underwhelming usage near the goal line remains a concern (his 10 carries inside the 5 ranked 17th last season). Nonetheless, Elliott is a young, high-end talent set for a ton of volume. With his contract situation resolved, he should be off the board in the top 4 of every draft.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":18.527847724799997,"appliedStats":{"53":23.6,"72":-2.893570536,"24":140.35999999999999,"25":68.4,"26":0.50625311,"42":39.34,"43":8.399999999999999,"44":0.132864134,"63":0.07216916400000001},"appliedTotal":277.917715872,"externalId":"2018","id":"102018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":323.9,"24":1403.6,"25":11.4,"26":0.253126555,"27":280.0,"28":140.0,"29":70.0,"30":56.0,"31":28.0,"32":14.0,"33":64.0,"34":32.0,"35":0.705469653,"36":0.493828757,"37":5.418601323,"38":0.184916074,"39":4.3334362457548625,"40":93.18674478,"41":47.2,"42":393.4,"43":1.4,"44":0.066432067,"45":0.073484168,"46":0.048021904,"47":78.0,"48":39.0,"49":19.0,"50":15.0,"51":7.0,"52":3.0,"53":47.2,"54":9.0,"55":4.0,"56":0.2320619,"57":0.007177172,"58":60.3,"60":8.334745762711863,"61":26.11901603,"62":0.319558622,"63":0.012028194,"66":2.67155825,"67":0.389050844,"68":3.1,"70":1.228916795,"71":0.217868472,"72":1.446785268,"73":1.446785268,"210":15.0}},{"appliedAverage":20.2264093526,"appliedStats":{"53":36.782143345,"72":-3.933546858,"24":135.9779245,"25":59.349286554,"26":0.455548462,"42":58.090786210000005,"43":16.340628882,"44":0.236631752,"63":0.09673744199999999},"appliedTotal":303.396140289,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":305.5143111,"24":1359.779245,"25":9.891547759,"26":0.227774231,"27":271.0,"28":135.0,"29":67.0,"30":54.0,"31":27.0,"33":61.0,"34":30.0,"35":0.659669829,"36":0.46176888,"37":5.104148667,"38":0.174185011,"39":4.450787396,"40":90.27580052,"42":580.9078621,"43":2.723438147,"44":0.118315876,"45":0.065337601,"46":0.042698122,"47":116.0,"48":58.0,"49":29.0,"50":23.0,"51":11.0,"53":73.56428669,"54":14.0,"55":7.0,"56":0.644002993,"57":0.019917618,"58":91.71340249,"60":7.896601574,"61":38.56649707,"62":0.346090107,"63":0.016122907,"66":3.306382473,"67":0.796138378,"68":4.102520851,"70":1.520935938,"71":0.445837492,"72":1.966773429,"73":1.966773429,"210":15.0625}},{"appliedStats":{"53":1.0,"24":12.5,"42":1.4000000000000001},"appliedTotal":14.9,"externalId":"401127921","id":"01401127921","proTeamId":6,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":19.0,"24":125.0,"27":25.0,"28":12.0,"29":6.0,"30":5.0,"31":2.0,"32":1.0,"33":3.0,"34":1.0,"37":1.0,"39":6.579,"40":125.0,"41":2.0,"42":14.0,"47":2.0,"48":1.0,"53":2.0,"58":3.0,"59":8.0,"60":7.0,"61":14.0,"155":1.0,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":2.066125028,"72":-0.167723294,"24":8.224825114,"25":3.7407333840000003,"26":0.029396168,"42":3.6966295060000003,"43":0.8190202019999999,"44":0.011611568,"63":0.004132014},"appliedTotal":18.42474969,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":18.11990245,"24":82.24825114,"25":0.623455564,"26":0.014698084,"27":16.0,"28":8.0,"29":4.0,"30":3.0,"31":1.0,"33":3.0,"34":1.0,"35":0.03879936,"36":0.027159552,"37":0.296,"38":0.0101,"39":4.539111144,"40":82.24825114,"42":36.96629506,"43":0.136503367,"44":0.005805784,"45":0.006716022,"46":0.004388921,"47":7.0,"48":3.0,"49":1.0,"50":1.0,"53":4.132250056,"56":0.041984243,"57":0.001298482,"58":5.183205394,"60":8.945803028,"61":36.96629506,"62":0.020503868,"63":6.88669E-4,"66":0.142692662,"67":0.032541111,"68":0.175233773,"70":0.065638624,"71":0.018223022,"72":0.083861647,"73":0.083861647,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":1.751306318,"72":-0.250335232,"24":10.17053894,"25":5.638240290000001,"26":0.041647516,"42":3.3117308160000003,"43":1.008962178,"44":0.014596356,"63":0.006232794},"appliedTotal":21.692919976,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":22.37356058,"24":101.7053894,"25":0.939706715,"26":0.020823758,"27":20.0,"28":10.0,"29":5.0,"30":4.0,"31":2.0,"33":4.0,"34":2.0,"35":0.049521806,"36":0.034665264,"37":0.453,"38":0.0155,"39":4.5457847,"40":101.7053894,"42":33.11730816,"43":0.168160363,"44":0.007298178,"45":0.008843567,"46":0.005779271,"47":6.0,"48":3.0,"49":1.0,"50":1.0,"53":3.502612636,"56":0.031056772,"57":9.60519E-4,"58":4.355259174,"60":9.455030175,"61":33.11730816,"62":0.028121935,"63":0.001038799,"66":0.22854619,"67":0.03577923,"68":0.264325421,"70":0.105131248,"71":0.020036369,"72":0.125167616,"73":0.125167616,"210":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":18.333855856846153,"appliedStats":{"53":26.921638525,"72":-2.203686588,"24":107.0885059,"25":48.98744302200001,"26":0.37632374,"42":46.74458449,"43":10.223436732,"44":0.147572392,"63":0.05430792599999999},"appliedTotal":238.340126139,"externalId":"2019","id":"122019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{"23":238.6215507,"24":1070.885059,"25":8.164573837,"26":0.18816187,"27":214.0,"28":107.0,"29":53.0,"30":42.0,"31":21.0,"33":47.0,"34":23.0,"35":0.512088846,"36":0.358462192,"3

touchdown and receiving yardage columns in 2018. The elite wideout was a frequent first-round pick in this summer's fantasy drafts and will remain a virtual must-start. He'll likely tangle with tough Vikings CB Xavier Rhodes, who's given him troubles in the past. However, even with a lower ceiling, Jones again belongs among the top 12-15 wideouts for Week 1.","2":"Jones found the end zone in Week 1 but averaged just 5.2 yards on his six catches. He had a wrap on his wrist on Monday, so watch to see whether or not that amounts to anything significant later in the week. Atlanta's Week 2 game is on Sunday night, which could complicate things. Still, if he's active against an Eagles defense that just let Washington's Case Keenum set a career-best passing day, Jones remains a solid fantasy WR1.","3":"Jones scored twice in Week 2, including a late 54-yard touchdown off a WR screen to win the game. His three touchdowns so far should have his fantasy shareholders optimistic heading into Week 3 versus the Colts, despite their strong defense so far. Neither of the Colts cornerbacks presents a daunting matchup, though bracketing him with safety Malik Hooker could limit his chances for big plays. You can start Jones with confidence as a fantasy WR1.","4":"Jones has seen at least nine targets and five catches in every game this season,  while scoring four touchdowns. After his 8-128-1 domination against the Colts in Week 3, his biggest fantasy concern -- red-zone attention -- looks like it's not a concern after all. Jones remains a star fantasy WR1 in Week 4 against the Titans, who've allowed three touchdowns to wideouts over the last two games."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":44.156346749226,"averageDraftPosition":11.53558926487748,"percentChange":0.01384160610608376,"percentOwned":99.91057296669199,"percentStarted":99.45261542032486},"proTeamId":1,"rankings":{"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":3.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":3.3333333333333335,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":1.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":1.6666666666666667,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":1,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":2.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":2.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":2.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"S

what you want about Jones' occasional touchdown deficiencies, he arguably has been the league's best wide receiver since entering the league in 2011. Incredibly, Jones' yards per target has ranked inside the top 20 wide receivers all eight seasons of his career. Despite an unlucky 2017 season in the touchdown department (3 TDs, 8.4 OTD), Jones predictably regressed to the mean and found paydirt eight times (8.0 OTD) in 2018. He finished fourth in fantasy points and hasn't finished a season worse than seventh since 2013. Jones is 30, but his game hasn't slipped, and a role that allowed a position-best eight top 10 fantasy weeks in 2018 is unlikely to change. He's a rock solid top 5 fantasy wideout.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":15.273051093874999,"appliedStats":{"53":47.3,"72":-1.023189972,"24":1.2400000000000002,"25":0.6000000000000001,"26":0.002554512,"42":148.91,"43":46.8,"44":0.51783003,"63":0.021622932},"appliedTotal":244.36881750199998,"externalId":"2018","id":"102018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":2.0,"24":12.4,"25":0.1,"26":0.001277256,"27":2.0,"28":1.0,"35":0.003726015,"36":0.00260821,"37":3.32755E-4,"38":1.13556E-5,"39":6.2,"40":0.776293794,"41":94.6,"42":1489.1,"43":7.8,"44":0.258915015,"45":0.408027974,"46":0.266646281,"47":297.0,"48":148.0,"49":74.0,"50":59.0,"51":29.0,"52":14.0,"53":94.6,"54":18.0,"55":9.0,"56":6.224803495,"57":0.192519696,"58":149.3,"60":15.741014799154334,"61":93.06675001,"62":0.260192271,"63":0.003603822,"66":0.019267858,"67":0.897735306,"68":0.9,"70":0.008863214,"71":0.502731771,"72":0.511594986,"73":0.511594986,"210":16.0}},{"appliedAverage":14.8767218354375,"appliedStats":{"53":47.49062115,"72":-1.342530416,"24":1.129669441,"25":0.283670226,"26":0.003900474,"42":141.6891208,"43":48.008739846000005,"44":0.735996974,"63":0.028360872000000002},"appliedTotal":238.027549367,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":1.831572356,"24":11.29669441,"25":0.047278371,"26":0.001950237,"27":2.0,"28":1.0,"35":0.003362496,"36":0.002353747,"37":2.68409E-4,"38":9.15977E-6,"39":6.167757649,"40":0.7060434,"42":1416.891208,"43":8.001456641,"44":0.367998487,"45":0.359072438,"46":0.234653838,"47":283.0,"48":141.0,"49":70.0,"50":56.0,"51":28.0,"53":94.9812423,"54":18.0,"55":9.0,"56":5.769387182,"57":0.178434655,"58":147.1463617,"60":14.91758977,"61":88.55570052,"62":0.369948724,"63":0.004726812,"66":0.022754486,"67":1.179996687,"68":1.202751173,"70":0.010467063,"71":0.660798145,"72":0.671265208,"73":0.671265208,"210":16.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":2.9546230015,"72":-0.070299394,"24":0.07198651760000001,"25":0.01678374,"26":2.66408E-4,"42":8.726203975999999,"43":3.185603232,"44":0.046123482,"63":0.001485138},"appliedTotal":14.932776101099998,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":0.11556414,"24":0.719865176,"25":0.00279729,"26":1.33204E-4,"35":2.1216E-4,"36":1.48512E-4,"37":1.74E-5,"38":5.94E-7,"39":6.229139746,"40":0.719865176,"42":87.26203976,"43":0.530933872,"44":0.023061741,"45":0.020936537,"46":0.013682027,"47":17.0,"48":8.0,"49":4.0,"50":3.0,"51":1.0,"53":5.909246003,"54":1.0,"56":0.352859739,"57":0.010913188,"58":9.231391092,"60":14.76703453,"61":87.26203976,"62":0.023194945,"63":2.47523E-4,"66":0.001208101,"67":0.061774948,"68":0.062983049,"70":5.55727E-4,"71":0.034593971,"72":0.035149697,"73":0.035149697,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":2.922189724,"72":-0.069837512,"24":0.0684596296,"25":0.016330536,"26":2.33944E-4,"42":8.678085203,"43":2.768093742,"44":0.042049778,"63":0.001476},"appliedTotal":14.427081044600001,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":0.109902222,"24":0.684596296,"25":0.002721756,"26":1.16972E-4,"35":2.01755E-4,"36":1.41229E-4,"37":1.54967E-5,"38":5.28843E-7,"39":6.229139746,"40":0.684596296,"42":86.78085203,"43":0.461348957,"44":0.021024889,"45":0.018819766,"46":0.012298717,"47":17.0,"48":8.0,"49":4.0,"50":3.0,"51":1.0,"53":5.844379448,"54":1.0,"56":0.349545496,"57":0.010810685,"58":9.447355051,"60":14.84859989,"61":86.78085203,"62":0.021141861,"63":2.46E-4,"66":0.001154733,"67":0.06140639,"68":0.062561123,"70":5.31177E-4,"71":0.034387579,"72":0.034918756,"73":0.034918756,"210":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":15.336792792623074,"appliedStats":{"53":39.205735725,"72":-0.932017894,"24":0.9030819691,"25":0.22013994599999998,"26":0.003609208,"42":115.4123173,"43":43.919025492,"44":0.626728438,"63":0.01968612},"appliedTotal":199.37830630409997,"externalId":"2019","id":"122019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{"23":1.449769962,"24":9.030819691,"25":0.036689991,"26":0.001804604,"27":1.0,"35":0.002661492,"36":0.001863045,"37":2.09338E-4,"38":7.14389E-6,"39":6.229139746,"40":0.694678438,"42":1154.123173,"43":7.319837582,"44":0.313364219,"45":0.268883633,"46":0.175715454,"47":230.0,"48":115.0,"49":57.0,"50":46.0,"51":23.0,"53":78.41147145,"54":15.0,"55":7.0,"56":4.711986677,"57":0.145731547,"58":122.493905,"60":14.71880519,"61":88.77870562,"62":0.315168823,"63":0.00328102,"66":0.015155819,"67":0.819709411,"68":0.834865231,"70":0.006971677,"71":0.45903727,"72":0.466008947,"73":0.466008947,"210":13.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":4.0,"42":12.8,"43":6.0},"appliedTotal":22.8,"externalId":"401127929","id":"01401127929","proTeamId":1,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"41":8.0,"42":128.0,"43":1.0,"47":25.0,"48":12.0,"49":6.0

for Fournette in Week 1 is supported by the Chiefs allowing the most yards per carry (4.96) to opposing tailbacks in 2018. Healthy and essentially unchallenged for every-down work to begin the season, Fournette is a potential RB1 candidate given the positive matchup and usage metrics in place.","2":"Despite registering his first career fumble and not scoring a touchdown, it still was somehow a promising opener for Fournette, who dominated backfield usage (no other back had more than one touch). He also led the team with 13 rushes and an impressive 5.1 yards per tote and was second on the team with six targets. Fournette remains a high-end RB2 heading into Week 2 against Houston's solid front seven.","3":"The workload has been there for Fournette to prove productive this season. The former LSU star is averaging 18 touches and 90.5 scrimmage yards, but a lack of touchdown production is holding him back from solid fantasy results. The Titans have been gashed on the ground to the tune of 117 yards per game allowed to tailbacks this season, helping Fournette's case as a volume-driven fantasy asset.","4":"Fournette hasn't gotten truly untracked this season and yet is still averaging 91 yards from scrimmage. The Broncos have limited opposing backs to just 3.49 yards per carry this season, but have also allowed a league-high five rushing scores to tailbacks this year. Given such a great weekly workload, Fournette remains a solid starting option."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":24.30185758513932,"averageDraftPosition":40.55813953488372,"percentChange":0.016868816981741475,"percentOwned":99.12060668242088,"percentStarted":91.59788136769833},"proTeamId":30,"rankings":{"0":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":12.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":12.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":21,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":16.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":14.833333333333334,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":49,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":50.666666666666664,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":10.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":9.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}]},"seasonOutlook":"Fournette hasn't quite lived up to lofty expectations since being selected fourth overall in the 2017 draft. The 24-year-old back has already missed 11 games and has seen his yards per carry fall from 3.9 in 2017 to 3.3 (fifth-worst) in 2018. Though, in his defense, Fournette has dealt with a large number of stacked boxes and horrific quarterback play. On the plus side, an extensive workload near the goal line (19 carries inside the 5 in 21 games) and good receiving efficiency (82 percent catch rate, 8.4 YPR) have helped him to two straight seasons finishing top-12 in fantasy points per game. Fournette's Trent Richardson-like efficiency woes are a concern, but the addition QB Nick Foles and massive volume he receives keep him in the RB1 discussion and offer hope for a breakout season.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":30.151000251999996,"appliedStats":{"53":19.85,"72":-2.417807412,"24":123.85000000000001,"25":60.599999999999994,"26":0.597804826,"42":32.54,"43":6.0,"44":0.12752912,"63":0.060475482},"appliedTotal":241.20800201599997,"externalId":"2018","id":"102018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":309.9,"24":1238.5,"25":10.1,"26":0.298902413,"27":247.0,"28":123.0,"29":61.0,"30":49.0,"31":24.0,"32":12.0,"33":61.0,"34":30.0,"35":0.670334991,"36":0.469234494,"37":4.219066518,"38":0.143980553,"39":3.996450467892869,"40":82.22520946,"41":39.7,"42":325.4,"43":1.0,"44":0.06376456,"45":0.061393235,"46":0.040120479,"47":65.0,"48":32.0,"49":16.0,"50":13.0,"51":6.0,"52":3.0,"53":39.7,"54":7.0,"55":3.0,"56":0.1533724,"57":0.004743476,"58":52.0,"60":8.196473551637279,"61":21.60491318,"62":0.362666973,"63":0.010079247,"66":2.273248535,"67":0.291445321,"68":2.6,"70":1.045694326,"71":0.16320938,"72":1.208903706,"73":1.208903706,"210":8.0}},{"appliedAverage":15.031561797428571,"appliedStats":{"53":24.64500579,"72":-1.62277436,"24":91.31169263000001,"25":48.76953324,"26":0.523274646,"42":39.49257266000001,"43":7.149813666,"44":0.132627736,"63":0.040119156},"appliedTotal":210.441865164,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":242.5027415,"24":913.1169263,"25":8.12825554,"26":0.261637323,"27":182.0,"28":91.0,"29":45.0,"30":36.0,"31":18.0,"33":48.0,"34":24.0,"35":0.507224006,"36":0.355056804,"37":2.294681707,"38":0.078308683,"39":3.765388056,"40":64.64544611,"42":394.9257266,"43":1.191635611,"44":0.066313868,"45":0.069555327,"46":0.045454406,"47":78.0,"48":39.0,"49":19.0,"50":15.0,"51":7.0,"53":49.29001158,"54":9.0,"55":4.0,"56":0.2350669,"57":0.00727011,"58":61.27874436,"60":8.012287154,"61":27.95934348,"62":0.327951191,"63":0.006686526,"66":1.414002369,"67":0.287403733,"68":1.701406102,"70":0.65044109,"71":0.16094609,"72":0.81138718,"73":0.81138718,"210":14.125}},{"appliedStats":{"53":2.065243907,"72":-0.193032828,"24":6.400224981,"25":2.184779982,"26":0.032338474,"42":3.2759201730000003,"43":0.623191944,"44":0.00978146,"63":0.00474},"appliedTotal":14.403188093,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":16.51804018,"24":64.00224981,"25":0.364129997,"26":0.016169237,"27":12.0,"28":6.0,"29":3.0,"30":2.0,"31":1.0,"33":3.0,"34":1.0,"35":0.034920552,"36":0.024444386,"37":0.179,"38":0.00612,"39":3.874687863,"40":64.00224981,"42":32.75920173,"43":0.103865324,"44":0.00489073,"45":0.003852931,"46":0.00251789,"47":6.0,"48":3.0,"49":1.0,"50":1.0,"53":4.130487814,"56":0.030154509,"57":9.32614E-4,"58":5.220239431,"60":7.931073327,"61":32.75920173,"62":0.021059967,"63":7.9E-4,"66":0.160851803,"67":0.040222472,"68":0.201074276,"70":0.07399183,"71":0.022524584,"72":0.096516414,"73":0.096516414,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":1.7528709835,"72":-0.144891256,"24":7.1192159649999995,"25":2.74383663,"26":0.031353688,"42":2.878291019,"43":0.434800356,"44":0.007905742,"63":0.003589338},"appliedTotal":14.826972465499999,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":18.50395285,"24":71.19215965,"25":0.457306105,"26":0.015676844,"27":14.0,"28":7.0,"29":3.0,"30":2.0,"31":1.0,"33":3.0,"34":1.0,"35":0.039742251,"36":0.027819576,"37":0.221809998,"38":0.007569524,"39":3.84740278,"40":71.19215965,"42":28.78291019,"43":0.072466726,"44":0.003952871,"45":0.00365976,"46":0.002391653,"47":5.0,"48":2.0,"49":1.0,"50":1.0,"53":3.505741967,"56":0.021386419,"57":6.61436E-4,"58":4.643214934,"60":8.210219252,"61":28.78291019,"62":0.019629714,"63":5.98223E-4,"66":0.127973858,"67":0.02424581,"68":0.152219668,"70":0.058867975,"71":0.013577654,"72":0.072445628,"73":0.072445628,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":3.0,"24":6.6000000000000005,"42":2.6},"appliedTotal":12.200000000000001,"externalId":"401127859","id":"01401127859","proTeamId":30,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"210":1.0,"23":15.0,"24":66.0,"27":13.0,"155":1.0,"28":6.0,"29":3.0,"30":2.0,"31":1.0,"33":3.0,"34":1.0,"39":4.4,"40":66.0,"41":6.0,"42":26.0,"47":5.0,"48":2.0,"49":1.0,"50":1.0,"53":6.0,"54":1.0,"58":8.0,"59":22.0,"60":4.333,"61":26.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":1.0,"24":22.5,"42":2.0},"appliedTotal":25.5,"externalId":"401128097","id":"01401128097","proTeamId":30,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"210":1.0,"23":29.0,"24":225.0,"27":45.0,"155":1.0,"28":22.0,"29":11.0,"30":9.0,"31":4.0,"32":2.0,"33":5.0,"34":2.0,"38":1.0,"39":7.759,"40":225.0,"41":2.0,"42":20.0,"47":4.0,"48":2.0,"49":1.0,"53":2.0,"58":3.0,"59":22.0,"60":10.0,"61":20.0}},{"appliedAverage":15.352655159153848,"appliedStats":{"53":28.182192905,"72":-2.560538058,"24":84.50422807000001,"25":3

Gordon maintained a substantial (albeit slightly reduced) share of the team's carries, and saw an uptick to 6.1 targets per game. That helped offset a bizarre drop in usage near the goal line; Gordon carried the ball inside the 5-yard line a total of 31 times during the 2016 and 2017 seasons but only four times in 2018. The goal-line usage is a concern, but Gordon is still in his prime at age 26 and is positioned for 300-plus touches in one of the league's better offenses.

breakout season many expected in 2018, going over the 1,000-yard mark and hauling in five touchdowns. He's tops among Lions wideouts on the depth chart and should be one off Matthew Stafford's most-frequent targets this season. The Cardinals don't present an amazing matchup for the Detroit passing game in Week 1, but there's no reason to bench Golladay, who is safely in the WR2 discussion to start the season.","2":"Golladay saw nine targets in Week 1, an encouraging sign and something to remember for those despairing after checking the box score to see a rookie tight end and veteran slot receiver racking up the yards in the Detroit passing game. It's far too early to despair, as Golladay did catch a touchdown and played the most snaps of any Detroit receiver. The Chargers were the fifth-toughest matchup for wideouts a year ago, but did allow T.Y. Hilton to score twice in Week 1, meaning Golladay is a strong Week 2 pick with some touchdown option -- consider him a high-end flex option. ","3":"Golladay found the end zone in Week 2, giving him two scores in two games to start his third season as a pro. He's been heavily targeted through two weeks and appears to be locked in as Matthew Stafford's top target. That's a great place to be entering a Week 3 matchup with the Eagles, who just allowed Calvin Ridley and Julio Jones to both go over 100 yards receiving on Sunday. That duo combined for three scores, as well, adding even more appeal to Golladay's matcup. He's a safe pick as a WR2 this week. ","4":"Detroit's top receiver in terms of touchdowns and targets, Golladay remains the Lions wideout to have in fantasy on a weekly basis. However, this offense has seen its share of ups and downs this season - and Week 3 was definitely a down for Golladay, who only caught two of the eight passes thrown his way. That certainly wasn't all his fault, and it's encouraging to see the volume of targets remained high even when things weren't working. Look for that to continue in a game that should feature plenty of scoring as the Lions host the Chiefs. Golladay is locked in as a WR2."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":14.405572755417957,"averageDraftPosition":63.24418895276181,"percentChange":-0.17564018617454735,"percentOwned":96.83358691883294,"percentStarted":73.90765405764093},"proTeamId":8,"rankings":{"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":20,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":17,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":16.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":15.833333333333334,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":23,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":24,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":26,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":24,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":28,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":22,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":26,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":30,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":26,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":23,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":26.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":24.666666666666668,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":11.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":11.833333333333334,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":35,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":35,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":35,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank"

Lions turned to a run-first scheme and struggled with efficiency last season, but that didn't stop Golladay from enjoying a breakout season. The 2017 third-round pick exploded for a 70/1063/5 line despite 25 percent of balls thrown his way registering as off target (15th highest). Golladay was limited to two top 10 fantasy weeks and his touchdown total leaves something to be desired (6.0 OTD), but he still managed to put together a 21st-place finish in fantasy points in 15 games. The 25-year-old is, at least, a fringe WR2 and there's upside for more in his third NFL season.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":8.836505610466668,"appliedStats":{"53":25.901270705,"72":-0.607452976,"42":76.41058272000001,"43":30.387617405999997,"44":0.442777248,"63":0.012789054000000001},"appliedTotal":132.54758415700002,"externalId":"2018","id":"102018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"41":51.80254141,"42":764.1058272,"43":5.064602901,"44":0.221388624,"45":0.224287527,"46":0.146571899,"47":152.0,"48":76.0,"49":38.0,"50":30.0,"51":15.0,"52":7.0,"53":51.80254141,"54":10.0,"55":5.0,"56":1.364904805,"57":0.042213551,"58":89.90731228,"60":14.750354063758278,"61":47.7566142,"62":0.221388624,"63":0.002131509,"67":0.542368728,"68":0.542368728,"71":0.303726488,"72":0.303726488,"73":0.303726488,"210":15.0}},{"appliedAverage":10.9683581573125,"appliedStats":{"53":36.357317775,"72":-0.920959654,"24":1.251120314,"25":0.349318542,"26":0.004948796,"42":102.2708539,"43":35.514547596,"44":0.64709814,"63":0.019485108},"appliedTotal":175.493730517,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":2.054691988,"24":12.51120314,"25":0.058219757,"26":0.002474398,"27":2.0,"28":1.0,"35":0.003772604,"36":0.002640823,"37":3.39655E-4,"38":1.15911E-5,"39":6.089089366,"40":0.781950196,"42":1022.708539,"43":5.919091266,"44":0.32354907,"45":0.210981821,"46":0.13787662,"47":204.0,"48":102.0,"49":51.0,"50":40.0,"51":20.0,"53":72.71463555,"54":14.0,"55":7.0,"56":2.915232073,"57":0.090161817,"58":122.3112484,"60":14.06468631,"61":63.91928369,"62":0.326023468,"63":0.003247518,"66":0.022708176,"67":0.80363226,"68":0.826340436,"70":0.010445761,"71":0.450034066,"72":0.460479827,"73":0.460479827,"210":16.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":2.243528188,"72":-0.052237156,"24":0.1469411131,"25":0.056110188000000005,"26":8.44468E-4,"42":6.574460467000001,"43":2.897045244,"44":0.050855708,"63":0.0011099999999999999},"appliedTotal":11.9186582201,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":0.237950057,"24":1.469411131,"25":0.009351698,"26":4.22234E-4,"35":4.37338E-4,"36":3.06137E-4,"37":8.38511E-5,"38":2.86152E-6,"39":6.175292196,"40":1.469411131,"42":65.74460467,"43":0.482840874,"44":0.025427854,"45":0.013697796,"46":0.00895151,"47":13.0,"48":6.0,"49":3.0,"50":2.0,"51":1.0,"53":4.487056376,"56":0.194622349,"57":0.00602,"58":7.771269524,"60":14.65205675,"61":65.74460467,"62":0.025850088,"63":1.85E-4,"66":0.002370108,"67":0.044693444,"68":0.047063552,"70":0.00109025,"71":0.025028329,"72":0.026118578,"73":0.026118578,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":2.534095142,"72":-0.057858692,"24":0.0694358772,"25":0.016046694,"26":2.66636E-4,"42":7.50619076,"43":2.02537857,"44":0.035686882,"63":0.001224},"appliedTotal":12.1304658692,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":0.114292243,"24":0.694358772,"25":0.002674449,"26":1.33318E-4,"35":2.09823E-4,"36":1.46876E-4,"37":1.6015E-5,"38":5.46532E-7,"39":6.075292196,"40":0.694358772,"42":75.0619076,"43":0.337563095,"44":0.017843441,"45":0.016033024,"46":0.010477581,"47":15.0,"48":7.0,"49":3.0,"50":3.0,"51":1.0,"53":5.068190284,"54":1.0,"56":0.263390989,"57":0.008146113,"58":8.52281098,"60":14.81039649,"61":75.0619076,"62":0.017976759,"63":2.04E-4,"66":0.001143782,"67":0.050720011,"68":0.051863792,"70":5.2614E-4,"71":0.028403206,"72":0.028929346,"73":0.028929346,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":1.0,"42":1.7000000000000002},"appliedTotal":2.7,"externalId":"401127959","id":"01401127959","proTeamId":8,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"41":2.0,"42":17.0,"47":3.0,"48":1.0,"53":2.0,"58":8.0,"60":8.5,"61":17.0,"155":1.0,"210":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":10.855418804538461,"appliedStats":{"53":28.004460955,"72":-0.64084798,"24":1.062303782,"25":0.299694816,"26":0.004712016,"42":82.11500709,"43":29.734100442000003,"44":0.52744786,"63":0.013565477999999999},"appliedTotal":141.120444459,"externalId":"2019","id":"122019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{"23":1.748666353,"24":10.62303782,"25":0.049949136,"26":0.002356008,"27":2.0,"28":1.0,"35":0.003211089,"36":0.002247762,"37":3.23873E-4,"38":1.10525E-5,"39":6.074936936,"40":0.817156755,"42":821.1500709,"43":4.955683407,"44":0.26372393,"45":0.171938789,"46":0.112361999,"47":164.0,"48":82.0,"49":41.0,"50":32.0,"51":16.0,"53":56.00892191,"54":11.0,"55":5.0,"56":2.298881276,"57":0.071099421,"58":98.03179372,"60":14.66105833,"61":63.16539007,"62":0.266079937,"63":0.002260913,"66":0.017417638,"67":0.557878352,"68":0.575295989,"70":0.008012113,"71":0.312411877,"72":0.32042399,"73":0.32042399,"210":13.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":2.5,"42":6.7,"43":12.0},"appliedTotal":21.2,"externalId":"401128023","id":"01401128023","proTeamId":8,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seaso

start the season in a big way with WR Golden Tate suspended. The third-year tight end improved his yards-per-target (9.0) and average reception yardage (12.8) in 2018 and should be busy in a likely comeback attempt against the Cowboys. Slot Engram comfortably in the TE1 fantasy tier for Week 1.","2":"Engram piled on 11 catches on 14 targets against the Cowboys, proving to be even busier than usual. Golden Tate was suspended and Sterling Shepard came out of this game with a concussion. Even if they were both on the field, Engram still has one of the safest workloads at his position. The Bills faced a Jets offense that didn't have much TE power, so don't count those stats against his outlook. He's still a fantasy TE1 in Week 2.","3":"Engram has seen 22 targets over the first two weeks of the season as the Giants receiving corps deals with numerous injuries and Golden Tate's suspension. In Week 3 against the Buccaneers, a team that has allowed 15.2 fantasy TE points-per-game (among the 10-highest rates), Engram should again lock in as a strong fantasy starter. Daniel Jones takes over at quarterback for New York, which could lead to an improved downfield passing game.","4":"Following a 6-113-1 Week 3 during Daniel Jones' debut at quarterback, Engram has now had at least eight targets, six receptions and one red-zone target in each of his first three games of 2019. The combination of Golden Tate's suspension and (in Week 3) Saquon Barkley's ankle injury have gradually opened up more targets for the talented third-year catcher. Besides, even when Tate returns, Engram will be heavily involved. Washington hasn't been damaged much by tight ends yet but their defense has allowed them to catch 85% of their targets so far, which helps cement Engram as a fantasy starter in Week 4."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":8.586687306501547,"averageDraftPosition":46.93706760023339,"percentChange":0.41488214592622796,"percentOwned":99.54230639695878,"percentStarted":95.81688838128981},"proTeamId":19,"rankings":{"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":4.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":4.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6}],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":4.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":3.8333333333333335,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":5.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":4.333333333333333,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":39,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":39,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":39,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6

first-round pick back in 2017, Engram has missed six games due to injury but has produced at a high level when he's been healthy. In fact, he's ranked fourth and seventh, respectively, in fantasy points per game during his two seasons. Engram enters his third season positioned for an even larger role after New York traded Odell Beckham to Cleveland. Engram exploded during the four games Beckham missed last season, posting weekly fantasy finishes of 12th, first, fourth and third to finish off the 2018 season.

He's also expected to miss around a month to begin 2019. When Green has been on the field, he has been effective, ranking no lower than 16th in fantasy points per game during each of his eight NFL seasons. Green, who is averaging 9.0 targets per game since the start of the 2017 season, turns 31 this season and figures to have a few good years left in the tank.

The Falcons let the Vikings offense pick them apart in Week 1, and though this game takes place in Atlanta, Wentz should put up capable borderline QB1 numbers in Week 2.","3":"Wentz struggled on the road in Week 2 at Atlanta but returns home against the Lions in Week 3. Unfortunately, injuries to three key receiving options -- Alshon Jeffery (calf), DeSean Jackson (groin) and Dallas Goedert (calf) -- loom over his fantasy outlook. If all are absent, downgrade him significantly. If some of them can play, Philadelphia should be able to adjust, with WR Nelson Agholor able to step in more frequently alongside star TE Zach Ertz. In the latter case, Wentz could remain a decent fantasy QB1. ","4":"Wentz has failed to surpass 259 passing yards in either of his past two games, despite logging six passes of 20-plus yards in Philadelphia's Week 3 loss. Having to play without Alshon Jeffery (calf) and DeSean Jackson (groin) could hurt him in Week 4, as well, especially with the quick turnaround to Thursday night at the Packers. Wentz was able to adapt without that duo in the lineup in Week 3 with depth options, though, which keeps Wentz on the border of being a fantasy QB1."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":1.8622291021671826,"averageDraftPosition":99.19304826206552,"percentChange":-0.9456724249164097,"percentOwned":95.39463254606295,"percentStarted":58.30068710608512},"proTeamId":21,"rankings":{"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":3.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":3.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":2.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":2.6666666666666665,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":10.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":8.833333333333334,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}],"4":[]},"seasonOutlook":"Wentz came back to earth last season following a breakout 2017 campaign in which he tossed 33 touchdowns and seven interceptions in 13 games prior to tearing his ACL. Wentz, who was third in fantasy points per game in 2017, fell to 17th last season during the 11 weeks he was active. On the plus side, Wentz finished top 15 in yards per attempt for the second season in a row and improved his completion rate from 60 to 70 percent (fourth best). Likely related to his ACL recovery but still notable, Wentz's rushing production plummeted (93 yards on 34 carries). Wentz has the support of a great offensive line and now has DeSean Jackson, JJ Arcega-Whiteside and Jordan Howard in his arsenal. He is best valued as a good QB2, but has huge upside.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":25.315221776,"appliedStats":{"19":3.260176424,"4":111.47067808,"20":-23.04276248,"8":155.0,"72":-9.552637652,"24":25.500081390000002,"25":15.319865952,"26":0.276390456,"63":0.235647366},"appliedTotal":278.46743953600003,"externalId":"2018","id":"102018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":541.1011884,"1":335.5801218,"2":205.52106659999998,"3":3882.525082,"4":27.86766952,"5":776.0,"6":388.0,"7":194.0,"8":155.0,"9":77.0,"10":38.0,"11":67.0,"12":33.0,"13":41.0,"14":20.0,"15":3.370441914,"16":2.202583791,"17":3.853340038,"18":0.520485204,"19":1.630088212,"20":11.52138124,"21":0.620179976,"22":260.1356839,"23":65.99609927,"24":255.0008139,"25":2.553310992,"26":0.138195228,"27":51.0,"28":25.0,"29":12.0,"30":10.0,"31":5.0,"32":2.0,"33":13.0,"34":6.0,"35":0.125956774,"36":0.088169742,"37":0.188582372,"38":0.006435593,"39":3.863877058199352,"40":17.08548167,"62":1.76828344,"63":0.039274561,"64":34.03374029,"65":8.964823279,"66":1.028703592,"68":9.993526871,"69":4.303115174,"70":0.473203652,"72":4.776318826,"73":16.29770007,"210":11.0}},{"appliedStats":{"4":12.0,"8":6.0,"24":1.3},"appliedTotal":19.3,"externalId":"401127863","id":"01401127863","proTeamId":21,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"0":27.0,"1":16.0,"2":11.0,"3":160.0,"4":3.0,"5":32.0,"6":16.0,"7":8.0,"8":6.0,"9":3.0,"10":1.0,"11":3.0,"12":1.0,"13":2.0,"14":1.0,"210":1.0,"21":59.259,"22":160.0,"23":6.0,"24":13.0,"27":2.0,"155":1.0,"28":1.0,"33":1.0,"39":2.167,"40":13.0,"175":2.0,"177":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":19.547697769866666,"appliedStats":{"19":4.455520336,"4":128.3257756,"20":-19.59110188,"8":159.0,"72":-9.462975588,"24":20.8269379,"25":9.2154276,"26":0.212578196,"63":0.23330438400000003},"appliedTotal":293.215466548,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":522.9660728,"1":348.1512962,"2":174.8147766,"3":3986.53875,"4":32.0814439,"5":797.0,"6":398.0,"7":199.0,"8":159.0,"9":79.0,"10":39.0,"11":69.0,"12":34.0,"15":3.350020075,"16":2.189238119,"17":3.553105298,"18":0.479931363,"19":2.227760168,"20":9.79555094,"21":0.665724441,"22":264.0091888,"23":55.03043811,"24":208.269379,"25":1.5359046,"26":0.106289098,"27":41.0,"28":20.0,"29":10.0,"30":8.0,"31":4.0,"33":11.0,"34":5.0,"35":0.104133004,"36":0.072893103,"37":0.117870523,"38":0.004022469,"39":3.784621496,"40":13.7926741,"62":2.334049266,"63":0.038884064,"64":36.85933032,"65":9.008622605,"66":0.885541181,"68":9.894163786,"69":4.32413885,"70":0.407348943,"72":4.731487794,"73":14.52703873,"210":15.1}},{"appliedStats":{"19":0.254992134,"4":6.817310564,"20":-1.577563374,"8":10.0,"72":-0.487587742,"24":1.420265119,"25":0.7105181580000001,"26":0.0145,"63":0.012},"appliedTotal":17.164434859,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"0":36.77487132,"1":23.30403828,"2":13.47083304,"3":261.7166886,"4":1.704327641,"5":52.0,"6":26.0,"7":13.0,"8":10.0,"9":5.0,"10":2.0,"11":4.0,"12":2.0,"15":0.229116383,"16":0.149727556,"17":0.26603504,"18":0.035934358,"19":0.127496067,"20":0.788781687,"21":0.633694625,"22":261.7166886,"23":3.598938597,"24":14.20265119,"25":0.118419693,"26":0.00725,"27":2.0,"28":1.0,"35":0.00682,"36":0.00477,"37":0.00874,"38":2.98E-4,"39":3.946344404,"40":14.20265119,"62":0.134749164,"63":0.002,"64":2.77352491,"65":0.467163,"66":0.0425,"68":0.509675241,"69":0.22423824,"70":0.0196,"72":0.243793871,"73":1.032575558,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"19":0.267926362,"4":7.297087684,"20":-1.825557494,"8":9.0,"72":-0.46052243,"24":1.362400046,"25":0.651680628,"26":0.01368,"63":0.01134},"appliedTotal":16.318034796000003,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"0":34.610285,"1":22.38148909,"2":12.22879591,"3":243.903729,"4":1.824271921,"5":48.0,"6":24.0,"7":12.0,"8":9.0,"9":4.0,"10":2.0,"11":4.0,"12":2.0,"15":0.201052015,"16":0.131387492,"17":0.203178228,"18":0.027444051,"19":0.133963181,"20":0.912778747,"21":0.646671621,"22":243.903729,"23":3.619958536,"24":13.62400046,"25":0.108613438,"26":0.00684,"27":2.0,"28":1.0,"35":0.00686,"36":0.0048,"37":0.00804,"38":2.74E-4,"39":3.763579147,"40":13.62400046,"62":0.140804136,"63":0.00189,"64":2.09807273,"65":0.438290205,"66":0.0432,"68":0.481511762,"69":0.210379299,"70":0.0199,"72":0.230261215,"73":1.143039962,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"4":8.0,"8":10.0,"24":3.3000000000000003},"appliedTotal":21.3,"externalId":"401127959","id":"01401127959","proTeamId":21,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"0":36.0,"1":19.0,"2":17.0,"3":259.0,"4":2.0,"5":51.0,"6":25.0,"7":12.0,"8":10.0,"9":5.0,"10":2.0,"11":3.0,"12":1.0,"13":3.0,"14":1.0,"21":52.778,"22":259.0,"23":4.0,"24":33.0,"27":6.0,"28":3.0,"29":1.0,"30":1.0,"39":8.25,"40

thumb splint and looks ready to serve as the Giants' top wide receiver for Week 1. The trade of Odell Beckham Jr., the four-game suspension of Golden Tate and a lack of other reliable wideouts all keep him in position to share most of the passing attention with TE Evan Engram. Even if those passes are coming from Eli Manning, Shepard still qualifies as a decent fantasy WR3 in Week 1 for volume alone against the Cowboys -- especially if the Giants must mount a furious comeback late in the contest.","2":"Shepard caught 6-of-7 targets in Week 1 but ended up in the league's concussion protocol, which jeopardizes his Week 2 availability. Buffalo contained Jets wideouts but allowed a big game to slot man Jamison Crowder, which would play well considering Shepard has a similar skill set. Still, even if he's active, Shepard is a fantasy WR3, at best.  ","3":"Shepard (concussion) missed Week 2 and is questionable against the Buccaneers in Week 3. If he suits up and Cody Latimer (concussion) doesn't, he could be a decent fantasy WR3 against the Buccaneers. Keep in mind, though, you may need to wait until late inactives land to make a decision, which may require a Plan B. (Maybe teammate Bennie Fowler?) Daniel Jones takes over at quarterback for New York, which could lead to an improved downfield passing game that could improve Shepard's weekly outlook whenever he does resurface.","4":"Shepard welcomed Daniel Jones as New York's new starting quarterback with open arms, as he went 7-100-1 on nine targets in Week 3. The new man under center elevates the Giants' weekly upside through the air, and Shepard should remain a heavy piece of this offense. He's a WR3 against Washington, despite a looming matchup with CB Josh Norman, though he may move around enough to avoid him. Washington, in fact, has allowed the most WR fantasy points-per-game so far in 2019."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":5.272445820433436,"averageDraftPosition":93.73087181196865,"percentChange":8.44163493053506,"percentOwned":88.5953551821139,"percentStarted":41.25912313915017},"proTeamId":19,"rankings":{"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":17,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":21,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":17,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":22,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":21,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":23,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":19.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":21.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"2":[],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":39,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":42,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":33,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":42,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":33,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":26,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":29,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":38,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":26,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":28,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":38.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":30.666666666666668,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":21,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":27,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":21,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":56,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":26,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":20,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":27,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":56,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":27,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":56,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":23.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":23.166666666666668,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":63,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":56,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23}]},"seasonOutlook":"Shepard received a contract extension during the offseason and, with Odell Beckham Jr. gone, he will team up with Golden Tate to lead the Giants' wide receiver position in 2019. The 2016 second-round pick averaged 6.3 targets per game during the 12 games Beckham played and 8.0 per game during the four he missed last season. Shepard has finished 36th, 42nd and 30th in fantasy points during his three seasons. Though the 25-year-old is primarily a short-to-intermediate area target (9.3 career aDOT) who doesn't add much in the touchdown department (six during the past two seasons), Shepard figures to reach a career-high in targets this season and that would allow him to push for WR2 production.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":9.489658886500001,"appliedStats":{"53":35.69829752,"72":-0.89158096,"24":2.6217848200000002,"25":0.57488955,"26":0.01020448,"42":82.31750770000001,"43":30.904070292,"44":0.580408248,"63":0.018960534},"appliedTotal":151.83454218400001,"externalId":"2018","id":"102018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":4.234500598,"24":26.2178482,"25":0.095814925,"26":0.00510224,"27":5.0,"28":2.0,"29":1.0,"30":1.0,"35":0.007784729,"36":0.00544931,"37":0.001698612,"38":5.79671E-5,"39":6.191485298734629,"40":1.638615512,"41":71.39659504,"42":823.175077,"43":5.150678382,"44":0.290204124,"45":0.111797179,"46":0.073059456,"47":164.0,"48":82.0,"49":41.0,"50":32.0,"51":16.0,"52":8.0,"53":71.39659504,"54":14.0,"55":7.0,"56":1.668614565,"57":0.051606636,"58":114.5483597,"60":11.52961253318615,"61":51.44844231,"62":0.295306364,"63":0.003160089,"66":0.045020312,"67":0.759073459,"68":0.804093771,"70":0.020709344,"71":0.425081137,"72":0.44579048,"73":0.44579048,"210":16.0}},{"appliedAverage":10.5349566028125,"appliedStats":{"53":36.458324625,"72":-0.577340842,"24":3.0640974940000003,"25":0.690277464,"26":0.008645754,"42":94.49991424000001,"43":33.756324726,"44":0.64677107,"63":0.012291113999999999},"appliedTotal":168.559305645,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":4.817714168,"24":30.64097494,"25":0.115046244,"26":0.004322877,"27":6.0,"28":3.0,"29":1.0,"30":1.0,"35":0.008863339,"36":0.006204337,"37":0.002736385,"38":9.33823E-5,"39":6.360064933,"40":1.915060933,"42":944.9991424,"43":5.626054121,"44":0.323385535,"45":0.177488559,"46":0.115988774,"47":188.0,"48":94.0,"49":47.0,"50":37.0,"51":18.0,"53":72.91664925,"54":14.0,"55":7.0,"56":2.396283443,"57":0.074111859,"58":117.8898181,"60":12.95999133,"61":59.0624464,"62":0.327708411,"63":0.002048519,"66":0.032305427,"67":0.488946295,"68":0.521251722,"70":0.014860496,"71":0.273809925,"72":0.288670421,"73":0.288670421,"210":16.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":3.5,"24":2.1,"42":10.0,"43":6.0,"44":2.0},"appliedTotal":23.6,"externalId":"401127966","id":"01401127966","proTeamId":19,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":2.0,"24":21.0,"27":4.0,"28":2.0,"29":1.0,"39":10.5,"40":21.0,"41":7.0,"42":100.0,"43":1.0,"44":1.0,"47":20.0,"48":10.0,"49":5.0,"50":4.0,"51":2.0,"52":1.0,"53":7.0,"54":1.0,"56":1.0,"58":9.0,"59":42.0,"60":14.286,"61":100.0,"62":1.0,"155":1.0,"158":8.0,"183":1.0,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":2.269259169,"72":-0.05155071,"24":0.5815475275,"25":0.18207789600000002,"26":0.002196586,"42":5.351428283000001,"43":2.46087015,"44":0.047239134,"63":0.001116},"appliedTotal":10.8441840355,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":0.916346397,"24":5.815475275,"25":0.030346316,"26":0.001098293,"27":1.0,"35":0.001694735,"36":0.001186315,"37":0.00144,"38":4.92E-5,"39":6.346372173,"40":5.815475275,"42":53.51428283,"43":0.410145025,"44":0.023619567,"45":0.009003367,"46":0.0058837,"47":10.0,"48":5.0,"49":2.0,"50":2.0,"51":1.0,"53":4.538518338,"56":0.115504921,"57":0.00357,"58":7.007908876,"60":11.79113509,"61":53.51428283,"62":0.024717859,"63":1.86E-4,"66":0.007971124,"67":0.039479711,"68":0.047450835,"70":0.003666717,"71":0.022108638,"72":0.025775355,"73":0.025775355,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":2.0938251995,"72":-0.04467674,"24":0.27349601419999997,"25":0.061164678,"26":7.36576E-4,"42":5.1158115,"43":1.61489091,"44":0.032279368,"63":9.600000000000001E-4},"appliedTotal":9.1484875057,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":0.447131299,"24":2.734960142,"25":0.010194113,"26":3.68288E-4,"35":8.23388E-4,"36":5.76371E-4,"37":3.07905E-4,"38":1.05076E-5,"39":6.116682396,"40":2.734960142,"42":51.158115,"43":0.269148485,"44":0.016139684,"45":0.009471803,"46":0.006189823,"47":10.0,"48":5.0,"49":2.0,"50":2.0,"51":1.0,"53":4.187650399,"56":0.10245783,"57":0.003168799,"58":6.619091521,"60":12.21642452,"61":51.158115,"62":0.016507972,"63":1.6E-4,"66":0.003915761,"67":0.036673428,"68":0.040589189,"70":0.00180125,"71":0.02053712,"72":0.02233837,"73":0.02233837,"210":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":10.051773921461537,"appliedStats":{"53":28.60575199,"72":-0.614930758,"24":4.541558867,"25":1.228793796,"26":0.01529273,"42":68.69232279,"43":27.662160348,"44":0.528901382,"63":0.013209834},"appliedTotal":130.67306097899998,"externalId":"2019","id":"122019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{"23":7.18964827,"24":45.41558867,"25":0.204798966,"26":0.007646365,"27":9.0,"28":4.0,"29":2.0,"30":1.0,"33":1.0,"35":0.013274904,"36":0.009292433,"37":0.008954308,"38":3.05576E-4,"39":6.31680257,"40":3.493506821,"42":686.9232279,"43":4.610360058,"4

With the potential to pressure Joe Flacco throughout the afternoon, the Jaguars' D/ST is in a solid spot to produce on the road this week."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":1.2768273716951788,"averageDraftPosition":94.66552501879542,"percentChange":11.605906458133688,"percentOwned":90.21423571335367,"percentStarted":75.85899387001962},"proTeamId":30,"rankings":{"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":17,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":17,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":23,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":23.333333333333332,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":22.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":23,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16}],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":7.333333333333333,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":6.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16}],"3":[],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":4.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":4.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16}]},"seasonOutlook":"The Jaguars' D/ST predictably took a step back in 2018 following about as dominant a defensive performance as you'll see in 2017. After ranking top-nine in every fantasy-relevant category the year prior, the 2018 Jaguars' D/ST fell to 22nd in forced turnovers (17) and 22nd in sacks (37). They still showed well in yardage allowed (fifth) and points allowed (fourth), however, which salvaged a top-10 fantasy campaign. Malik Jackson's offseason release is notable, but 2018 first-round pick Taven Bryan is waiting in the wings and joins a terrific core led by Calais Campbell, Myles Jack, Jalen Ramsey, A.J. Bouye and first-round pick Josh Allen. This extremely talented group should be one of the first D/STs off the board, though streamers should note that the Jaguars play the Chiefs in Week 1.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":7.622551774874999,"appliedStats":{"96":17.980852812,"97":2.617428144,"98":0.757120522,"99":44.10246475,"101":0.624267,"102":3.758561832,"103":10.37003292,"104":7.932891624,"93":0.748635594,"95":33.0685732},"appliedTotal":121.96082839799999,"externalId":"2018","id":"102018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"93":0.124772599,"94":3.050487424,"95":16.5342866,"96":8.990426406,"97":1.308714072,"98":0.378560261,"99":44.10246475,"100":88.0,"101":0.1040445,"102":0.626426972,"103":1.72833882,"104":1.322148604,"105":3.905731495,"106":13.83142524,"112":55.91318635,"113":80.83485473,"114":783.1112727,"115":326.0202231,"120":316.4650017,"121":16.0,"126":19.77906261,"127":5385.104174,"131":16.0,"137":336.5690109,"160":-316.4650017,"210":16.0}},{"appliedAverage":6.32563768775,"appliedStats":{"96":13.127877188,"97":1.4467328,"98":0.475659524,"130":4.0,"99":40.90729437,"132":-3.0,"101":1.070172,"102":4.23502023,"103":8.17400064,"104":4.4622144,"92":3.0,"93":0.734214912,"95":22.57701694},"appliedTotal":101.210203004,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"92":3.0,"93":0.122369152,"94":2.10603584,"95":11.28850847,"96":6.563938594,"97":0.7233664,"98":0.237829762,"99":40.90729437,"100":81.81458875,"101":0.178362,"102":0.705836705,"103":1.36233344,"104":0.7437024,"105":3.112603697,"106":10.09836707,"109":879.8245047,"110":293.0,"111":175.0,"113":69.2407579,"114":731.7246,"115":405.6460167,"116":73.0,"117":29.0,"118":40.0,"119":16.0,"120":311.4279373,"121":9.0,"122":4.0,"126":19.46424608,"127":5263.50491,"130":2.0,"131":11.0,"132":3.0,"137":328.9690569,"160":-311.4279373,"210":16.0}},{"appliedStats":{"96":0.991268232,"97":0.0978432,"98":0.031535424,"99":2.582406479,"101":0.03708,"102":0.212532,"103":0.5201088,"104":0.29126399999999997,"92":1.0,"93":0.048475008,"95":1.128927942},"appliedTotal":6.941441084999999,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"92":1.0,"93":0.008079168,"94":0.1352288,"95":0.564463971,"96":0.495634116,"97":0.0489216,"98":0.015767712,"99":2.582406479,"100":5.164812958,"101":0.00618,"102":0.035422,"103":0.0866848,"104":0.048544,"105":0.184909968,"106":0.762514024,"109":56.03092802,"110":18.0,"111":11.0,"113":4.269549809,"114":42.51090909,"115":21.82696194,"116":4.0,"117":1.0,"118":2.0,"120":15.935591,"126":15.935591,"127":328.8077014,"131":1.0,"137":328.8077014,"160":-15.935591,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"96":0.883689546,"97":0.0901992,"98":0.028760282,"99":2.56536971,"101":0.03708,"102":0.20626090199999997,"103":0.4804665,"104":0.269748,"92":1.0,"93":0.044799408,"95":1.076651222},"appliedTotal":6.683024769999999,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"92":1.0,"93":0.007466568,"94":0.12503575,"95":0.538325611,"96":0.441844773,"97":0.0450996,"98":0.014380141,"99":2.56536971,"100":5.13073942,"101":0.00618,"102":0.034376817,"103":0.08007775,"104":0.044958,"105":0.173059135,"106":0.67976119,"109":51.21259783,"110":17.0,"111":10.0,"113":4.136863071,"114":42.51090909,"115":21.86122454,"116":4.0,"117":1.0,"118":2.0,"120":15.29091684,"126":15.29091684,"127":317.1165256,"131":1.0,"137":317.1165256,"160":-15.29091684,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"96":2.0,"128":0.0,"129":0.0,"130":0.0,"99":9.0,"132":0.0,"133":0.0,"134":0.0,"135":0.0,"136":0.0,"89":0.0,"90":0.0,"123":0.0,"91":3.0,"92":0.0,"124":0.0},"appliedTotal":14.0,"externalId":"401127859","id":"01401127859","proTeamId":30,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"192":0.0,"128":0.0,"193":0.0,"129":0.0,"194":0.0,"130":0.0,"195":0.0,"131":1.0,"132":0.0,"133":0.0,"134":0.0,"135":0.0,"136":0.0,"210":1.0,"89":0.0,"90":0.0,"155":1.0,"91":1.0,"92":0.0,"96":1.0,"99":9.0,"100":18.0,"106":2.0,"107":29.0,"108":43.0,"109":72.0,"110":24.0,"111":14.0,"112":2.0,"113":4.0,"115":11.0,"118":1.0,"120":7.0,"121":0.0,"122":0.0,"187":7.0,"123":0.0,"124":0.0,"188":0.0,"189":0.0,"190":1.0,"191":0.0,"127":340.0}},{"appliedStats":{"128":0.0,"129":0.0,"130":0.0,"132":-1.0,"133":0.0,"134":0.0,"135":0.0,"136":0.0,"89":0.0,"90":0.0,"123":0.0,"91":0.0,"92":0.0,"124":0.0,"95":2.0},"appliedTotal":1.0,"externalId":"401128097","id":"01401128097","proTeamId":30,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"192":0.0,"128":0.0,"193":1.0,"129":0.0,"194":0.0,"130":0.0,"195":0.0,"131":0.0,"132":1.0,"133":0.0,"134":0.0,"135":0.0,"136":0.0,"210":1.0,"89":0.0,"90":0.0,"155":1.0,"91":0.0,"92":0.0,"95":1.0,"107":22.0,"108":29.0,"109":51.0,"110":17.0,"111":10.0,"113":4.0,"115":5.0,"120":24.0,"121":0.0,"122":1.0,"187":24.0,"123":0.0,"124":0.0,"188":0.0,"189":0.0,"190":0.0,"191":0.0,"127":371.0}},{"appliedAverage":8.314711527230768,"appliedStats":{"96":16.315937534,"128":15.

of several quarterbacks who must be evaluated differently by fantasy managers because of his production as a runner. He finished with the fifth-most rushing yards of signal-callers last season, giving him a very healthy floor in terms of weekly point hauls. So, while a matchup with the Packers seems mediocre, consider that he carried the ball for 32 yards and a score to open the season against them last year. That's a nice chunk of points before you even look to his passing line. He's a QB2, but not one to shy away from.","2":"Trubisky did not impress in his 2019 debut, averaging only 5.1 yards-per-attempt and failing to find the end zone as his team managed to put only three points on the scoreboard. However, Thursday games can often be outliers and fantasy managers should not have expected a ton out of a still-developing young passer. His outlook is a bit better for Week 2, as he'll face a Broncos defense that allowed Derek Carr to produce an impressive 10 yards-per-attempt with no interceptions or sacks allowed in Week 1. There are still quite a few preferred options out there, including many on waiver wires in most leagues, but Trubisky is in the conversation as a QB2 for leagues that start more than one signal-caller.","3":"Trubisky enters Week 3 in need of a breakout performance, having yet to score a touchdown and leading his Chicago's offense to only 19 points thus far on the season. That said, he has faced two tough defenses (Green Bay and Denver) and Week 3 brings an easier matchup against Washington -- a team that has given up three TD passes in both of its first two contests. This is a prime spot for Trubisky to break out of his early-season funk, so he's a borderline QB1 and certainly someone to consider in 2-QB leagues.","4":"Trubisky had a breakout game in Week 3, passing for three touchdowns in a much-needed big win over Washington. After facing two of the league's tougher pass defenses in Green Bay and Denver, it was encouraging to see Trubisky fare better in a more favorable matchup. Week 4 brings another tough contest, however, as divisional rival Minnesota comes to town. That relegates Trubisky back to the fantasy bench, although he's certainly a name to keep an eye on as a streaming option later in the year."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":0.48297213622291024,"averageDraftPosition":159.38501291989664,"percentChange":-5.9647257301485865,"percentOwned":41.62706519728851,"percentStarted":8.99614470323355},"proTeamId":3,"rankings":{"1":[],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":20,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":20,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":20,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":19.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":19.166666666666668,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":21,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":20,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":15.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":15.166666666666666,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":17,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":24,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":24,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":24.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":24.666666666666668,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":24,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}]},"seasonOutlook":"Trubisky took a giant step forward in his second season, throwing for 3,223 yards and 24 touchdowns, while adding 421 yards (fifth most among quarterbacks) and three touchdowns with his legs in 14 games. He ranked 11th in fantasy points per game. A closer look shows average or worse efficiency nearly across the board, including a 2.8 percent interception rate (11th worst). Trubisky has struggled with accuracy, as shown by his 20 percent off-target rate in 2017 (sixth worst) and 19 percent rate in 2018 (seventh worst). Trubisky's rushing ability and good supporting cast help his fantasy appeal, but he hasn't proven to be a good -- or even average -- starting quarterback yet.

in deeper PPR leagues given his ability to thrive over the middle -- a coveted trait in an Adam Gase offense -- it's difficult to trust Crowder in starting lineups this week against a Bills defense

It's more than likely Crowder never gets 19 targets in a game again this year, but double-digit looks is reasonable to expect in this matchup against a sound, if exploitable, Cleveland back seven. Driven by a high-volume role, Crowder is a solid WR3 or flex this Monday night.","3":"The target hog role from Week 1 didn't translate into Week 2 for Crowder, as he dealt six targets with modest depth of target in the loss to Cleveland this past Monday. Even with a third-string quarterback possibly behind center, Crowder is still in the flex discussion given his ability to churn out PPR points in a game that could see the Jets forced to pass against the Pats."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":0.9876160990712074,"averageDraftPosition":138.67744624104017,"percentChange":-9.591521274505169,"percentOwned":62.22513663069698,"percentStarted":2.624035610843878},"proTeamId":20,"rankings":{"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":44,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":44,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":49,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":44,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":45,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":36,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":43,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":46,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":48,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":41,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":44.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":43.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":28,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":31,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":22,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":31,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":26,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":20,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":22,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":29,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":20,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":22,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":28.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":23.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":36,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":34,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":29,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":35,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":34,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":38,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":26,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":46,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":47,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":37.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":37.666666666666664,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}]},"seasonOutlook":"Crowder joins the Jets after spending his first four seasons in Washington. Crowder aligned inside on 77 percent of his routes during four seasons with Washington and will operate between Robby Anderson and Quincy Enunwa in New York. Crowder cleared 65 receptions and 780 receiving yards in both 2016 and 2017, posting his best fantasy campaign (26th) during the former, but missed seven games due to injury in 2018. Extremely undersized, the 5-foot-8, 185-pound Crowder has 14 touchdowns (13.3 OTD) in 56 career games, seven of which came during the aforementioned 2016 season. New Jets head coach Adam Gase has made good use of his receivers, which adds to Crowder's fantasy appeal. He's a fine target in the middle rounds, but downgrade him in non-PPR leagues.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":16.640991112555557,"appliedStats":{"53":35.351183115,"102":1.8433902,"72":-1.307291478,"24":4.113575148000001,"25":1.02195489,"26":0.007572254,"42":84.12439488000001,"43":24.373529862,"44":0.212621208,"63":0.027989933999999998},"appliedTotal":149.768920013,"externalId":"2018","id":"102018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":7.282977112,"24":41.13575148,"25":0.170325815,"26":0.003786127,"27":8.0,"28":4.0,"29":2.0,"30":1.0,"33":1.0,"35":0.01341271,"36":0.009388897,"37":0.004354776,"38":1.48612E-4,"39":5.6482055136795,"40":2.570984467,"41":70.70236623,"42":841.2439488,"43":4.062254977,"44":0.106310604,"45":0.185713699,"46":0.121363902,"47":168.0,"48":84.0,"49":42.0,"50":33.0,"51":16.0,"52":8.0,"53":70.70236623,"54":14.0,"55":7.0,"56":1.766566464,"57":0.054636076,"58":103.7811823,"60":11.898384646185272,"61":52.5777468,"62":0.110096731,"63":0.004664989,"66":0.110854671,"67":1.07616534,"68":1.18702001,"70":0.050993149,"71":0.60265259,"72":0.653645739,"73":0.653645739,"102":0.3072317,"115":211.6414,"210":9.0}},{"appliedAverage":8.43771602,"appliedStats":{"53":30.78499479,"72":-0.985061282,"24":2.312323638,"25":0.42453689400000005,"26":0.005910916,"42":75.24939147,"43":26.773344425999998,"44":0.417053616,"63":0.020961852},"appliedTotal":135.00345632,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":3.896612316,"24":23.12323638,"25":0.070756149,"26":0.002955458,"27":4.0,"28":2.0,"29":1.0,"35":0.007162231,"36":0.005013562,"37":0.001309333,"38":4.46825E-5,"39":5.934189625,"40":1.445202274,"42":752.4939147,"43":4.462224071,"44":0.208526808,"45":0.176432338,"46":0.115298533,"47":150.0,"48":75.0,"49":37.0,"50":30.0,"51":15.0,"53":61.56998958,"54":12.0,"55":6.0,"56":1.310784608,"57":0.04053973,"58":94.07100375,"60":12.22176453,"61":47.03086967,"62":0.211482265,"63":0.003493642,"66":0.052911894,"67":0.83605566,"68":0.888967555,"70":0.024339471,"71":0.46819117,"72":0.492530641,"73":0.492530641,"210":16.0}},{"appliedStats":{},"appliedTotal":0.0,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{}},{"appliedStats":{"53":2.50003059,"72":-0.075780606,"24":0.1094315763,"25":0.017163192,"26":2.64E-4,"42":5.638596387,"43":0.9194053440000001,"44":0.01499553,"63":0.001606002},"appliedTotal":9.1257120153,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":0.190970286,"24":1.094315763,"25":0.002860532,"26":1.32E-4,"35":3.5084E-4,"36":2.45588E-4,"37":4.44E-5,"38":1.52E-6,"39":5.730293374,"40":1.094315763,"42":56.38596387,"43":0.153234224,"44":0.007497765,"45":0.008386112,"46":0.005480324,"47":11.0,"48":5.0,"49":2.0,"50":2.0,"51":1.0,"53":5.00006118,"54":1.0,"56":0.132461685,"57":0.0041,"58":7.508692536,"60":11.27705479,"61":56.38596387,"62":0.007629758,"63":2.67667E-4,"66":0.002505617,"67":0.06560307,"68":0.068108686,"70":0.001152584,"71":0.036737719,"72":0.037890303,"73":0.037890303,"210":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":8.642195870076922,"appliedStats":{"53":27.40346349,"72":-0.84161011,"24":1.8876164610000001,"25":0.35485476,"26":0.005989256,"42":63.01352836,"43":20.211064788,"44":0.295742134,"63":0.017897172000000003},"appliedTotal":112.34854631099999,"externalId":"2019","id":"122019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{"23":3.237870667,"24":18.87616461,"25":0.05914246,"26":0.002994628,"27":3.0,"28":1.0,"35":0.00595179,"36":0.004166253,"37":0.001080398,"38":3.68698E-5,"39":5.829808091,"40":1.452012662,"42":630.1352836,"43":3.368510798,"44":0.147871067,"45":0.114179028,"46":0.074615995,"47":126.0,"48":63.0,"49":31.0,"50":25.0,"51":12.0,"53":54.80692698,"54":10.0,"55":5.0,"56":1.160280256,"57":0.035884956,"58":83.25283502,"60":11.49736572,"61":48.47194489,"62":0.150865695,"63":0.002982862,"66":0.042338636,"67":0.716659433,"68":0.75899807,"70":0.019475773,"71":0.401329283,"72":0.420805055,"73":0.420805055,"210":13.0}},{"appliedAverage":7.58888888888889,"appliedStats":{"53":14.5,"24":3.0,"42":38.800000000000004,"43":12.0},"appliedTotal":68.30000000000001,"externalId":"2018","id":"002018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":4.0,"24":30.0,"27":6.0,"28":2.0,"29":1.0,"30":1.0,"39":7.5,"40":1.875,"41":29.0,"42":388.0,"43":2.0,"45":1.0,"46":1.0,"47":74.0,"48":33.0,"49":14.0,"50":12.0,"51":3.0,"53":29.0,"54":1.0,"58":50.0,"59":109.0,"60":13.379310344827585,"61":24.25,"115":20.0,"118":2.0,"155":7.0,"156":9.0,"174":0.4375,"210":9.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":1.0,"42":2.5},"appliedTotal":3.5,"externalId":"401127861","id":"01401127861","proTeamId":20,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"41":2.0,"42":25.0,"47":5.0,"48":2.0,"49":1.0,"50":1.0,"5

complicated situation in Chicago, only to try his luck in a complicated situation in Philadelphia. Still, he has plenty of positives with which to work -- including a more competent quarterback in Carson Wentz and a clear advantage in goal-line and early-down work. Miles Sanders could prove to be an exciting complement, but Howard should be a busy back in Week 1 against Washington, who is trotting out QB Case Keenum and is still developing many parts of its game. Howard is a useful fantasy flex play, with a potential bump to RB2 in non-PPR formats that enhance TD-centric potential.","2":"Howard scrounged together 55 scrimmage yards in Week 1, thanks to an unexpected situation where the Eagles needed to log a comeback for a victory against Washington. In settings when the Eagles will have more control over the game flow, Howard should be busier. Atlanta's light run defense was trampled by the Vikings in Week 1, so expect Howard to show a glimmer of workhorse duties in Week 2, making him a solid fantasy flex.","3":"Howard spun his wheels, gaining just 18 yards on six carries in Week 2, reminding fantasy players of how shaky his week-to-week workload is in this offense. However, Week 3 could be tantalizing. The Lions have allowed 169.5 RB scrimmage yards-per-game. Howard and Miles Sanders could each enjoy a big day, and the Eagles may rely more heavily on the run if at least one of Alshon Jeffery (calf), DeSean Jackson (groin) and Dallas Goedert (calf) is forced to be inactive. Howard can be a handy fantasy flex for Week 3, with the upside of an RB2 if things go in Philadelphia's favor, allowing them to chew time off the clock late.","4":"Howard added a touchdown to an otherwise mediocre day in Week 3. He could be leaned on heavily in Week 4, at least in the similar 11-touch role he had on Sunday, After all, the Eagles are still dealing with injuries to Alshon Jeffery (calf) and DeSean Jackson (groin), which could make the running game more important. He's an acceptable flex play, especially with bye weeks starting."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":0.6904024767801857,"averageDraftPosition":150.28121353558927,"percentChange":-6.245468124308289,"percentOwned":55.976384949249855,"percentStarted":6.428707722451955},"proTeamId":21,"rankings":{"0":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":50,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":50,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2}],"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":36,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":36,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":36,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":29,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":31,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":32,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":23,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":28,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":28,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":30.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":31.833333333333332,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":33,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":48,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":38,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":48,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":36,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":38,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":36,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":35,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":45,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":42,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":40.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":41.166666666666664,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":41,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":43,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":45,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":43,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":43,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":43,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":46,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":41,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":45,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":42,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":43.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":44.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":45,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"4":[]},"seasonOutlook":"Howard was traded to the Eagles after a successful three-year tenure in Chicago. With 3,370 career rushing yards, the 2016 fifth-round pick trails only Ezekiel Elliott and Todd Gurley II in the category the past three seasons. Howard has rushed for nine touchdowns each of the past two seasons but has seen both his yards per carry and yards after contact numbers fall each of the past two seasons. He has finished as a top-20 fantasy back in each of his three seasons despite a lack of receiving volume (106 career targets) and efficiency (career 68 percent catch rate and 5.4 YPT). Howard will share touches with rookie Miles Sanders and Darren Sproles this season, so his role as an early-down and short-yardage bruiser will limit him to flex numbers in non-PPR leagues.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":11.7743484176875,"appliedStats":{"53":14.546772835,"72":-1.751476904,"24":102.2928593,"25":43.57109343,"26":0.390800722,"42":23.320377530000002,"43":5.901832488,"44":0.073457994,"63":0.043857288},"appliedTotal":188.389574683,"externalId":"2018","id":"102018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":239.2145975,"24":1022.928593,"25":7.261848905,"26":0.195400361,"27":204.0,"28":102.0,"29":51.0,"30":40.0,"31":20.0,"32":10.0,"33":47.0,"34":23.0,"35":0.499590438,"36":0.349713306,"37":2.879221215,"38":0.098256774,"39":4.276196367991297,"40":67.91227173,"41":29.09354567,"42":233.2037753,"43":0.983638748,"44":0.036728997,"45":0.054621355,"46":0.035695055,"47":46.0,"48":23.0,"49":11.0,"50":9.0,"51":4.0,"52":2.0,"53":29.09354567,"54":5.0,"55":2.0,"56":0.089296283,"57":0.002761741,"58":38.46246598,"60":8.015653297991436,"61":15.48240832,"62":0.232129358,"63":0.007309548,"66":1.658256919,"67":0.201679053,"68":1.859935971,"70":0.762798183,"71":0.112940269,"72":0.875738452,"73":0.875738452,"210":16.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":1.5,"24":8.700000000000001,"25":12.0,"42":2.8000000000000003,"43":6.0},"appliedTotal":31.000000000000004,"externalId":"401127863","id":"01401127863","proTeamId":21,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"210":1.0,"23":15.0,"24":87.0,"25":2.0,"27":17.0,"155":1.0,"28":8.0,"29":4.0,"158":18.0,"30":3.0,"31":1.0,"33":3.0,"34":1.0,"39":5.8,"40":87.0,"41":3.0,"42":28.0,"43":1.0,"47":5.0,"48":2.0,"49":1.0,"50":1.0,"179":2.0,"53":3.0,"185":1.0,"58":4.0,"59":31.0,"60":9.333,"61":28.0}},{"appliedAverage":7.245195412333333,"appliedStats":{"53":6.00254985,"72":-1.19327351,"24":61.16233896,"25":29.518627578,"26":0.681201964,"42":9.092547723000001,"43":3.30693225,"44":0.076907442,"63":0.030098928000000004},"appliedTotal":108.67793118499999,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":149.8953972,"24":611.6233896,"25":4.919771263,"26":0.340600982,"27":122.0,"28":61.0,"29":30.0,"30":24.0,"31":12.0,"33":29.0,"34":14.0,"35":0.299311197,"36":0.209517838,"37":1.045725158,"38":0.035686588,"39":4.080334693,"40":40.60570222,"42":90.92547723,"43":0.551155375,"44":0.038453721,"45":0.040725266,"46":0.026613961,"47":18.0,"48":9.0,"49":4.0,"50":3.0,"51":1.0,"53":12.0050997,"54":2.0,"55":1.0,"56":0.039792553,"57":0.001230698,"58":16.27586032,"60":7.573904382,"61":6.036546206,"62":0.379054703,"63":0.005016488,"66":1.181809215,"67":0.094650921,"68":1.276460136,"70":0.543632239,"71":0.053004516,"72":0.596636755,"73":0.596636755,"210":15.0625}},{"appliedStats":{"53":0.6365696865,"72":-0.072759998,"24":4.048773972,"25":2.025760032,"26":0.041358642,"42":0.9873991911,"43":0.278779344,"44":0.00695361,"63":0.001818},"appliedTotal":7.9546524796,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":9.514990134,"24":40.48773972,"25":0.337626672,"26":0.020679321,"27":8.0,"28":4.0,"29":2.0,"30":1.0,"33":1.0,"35":0.018985253,"36":0.013289677,"37":0.0716,"38":0.00244,"39":4.255153096,"40":40.48773972,"42":9.873991911,"43":0.046463224,"44":0.003476805,"45":0.002328318,"46":0.001521556,"47":1.0,"53":1.273139373,"56":0.003754194,"57":1.16E-4,"58":1.806648262,"60":7.755625285,"61":9.873991911,"62":0.024156126,"63":3.03E-4,"66":0.0680089,"67":0.009099832,"68":0.077108731,"70":0.031284094,"71":0.005095906,"72":0.036379999,"73":0.036379999,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":0.3631332315,"72":-0.066352198,"24":3.9165775070000004,"25":1.683665736,"26":0.0354,"42":0.5655156556,"43":0.19095264,"44":0.004676066,"63":0.0016738679999999998},"appliedTotal":6.6952425061000005,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":9.146820409,"24":39.16577507,"25":0.280610956,"26":0.0177,"27":7.0,"28":3.0,"29":1.0,"30":1.0,"33":1.0,"35":0.018193523,"36":0.012735466,"37":0.067,"38":0.00229,"39":4.28190052,"40":39.16577507,"42":5.655156556,"43":0.03182544,"44":0.002338033,"45":0.002421914,"46":0.001582721,"47":1.0,"53":0.726266463,"56":0.002478812,"57":7.66643E-5,"58":1.020612606,"60":7.786613924,"61":5.655156556,"62":0.020012154,"63":2.78978E-4,"66":0.065764976,"67":0.005221803,"68":0.070986779,"70":0.030251889,"71":0.00292421,"72":0.033176099,"73":0.033176099,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"24":3.7,"25":6.0},"appliedTotal":9.7,"externalId":"401127959","id":"01401127959","proTeamId":21,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":11.0,"24":37.0,"25":1.0,"27":7.0,"28":3.0,"29":1.0,"30":1.0,"33":2.0,"34":1.0,"39":3.364,"40":37.0,"58":1.0,"156":1.0,"158":6.0,"179":1.0,"210":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":8.617998811384616,"appliedStats":{"53":7.90057793,"72":-1.025270094,"24":57.98386506000001,"25":30.435220110000003,"26":0.599914838,"42":11.972031

WR3 work with rookie JJ Arcega-Whiteside -- a troubling development for him to scrape together attention in an already crowded Eagles receiving picture. Leave him on fantasy waiver wires for now, but he'll probably be useful later in the year if an injury surfaces or bye-week replacements thin out.","2":"Agholor totaled just 11 yards despite getting five targets in Week 1. He may not be that busy unless, as was the case in Week 1, the Eagles are in comeback mode. Behind Zach Ertz, Alshon Jeffery and DeSean Jackson, more often than not he won't find much work headed his way. Leave him on fantasy waiver wires.","3":"Agholor stepped up in Week 2 after injuries ended the game for both Alshon Jeffery (calf) and DeSean Jackson (groin). He'd again be in line for an expanded role if at least one of them is absent. Either way, against the Lions, Agholor would at least be a flex. Multiple inactives among this WR corps could slide him up to a fantasy WR3. Keep an eye on who suits up and adjust expectations accordingly.","4":"Despite becoming a hashtag after a few mistakes, Agholor paid off for his fantasy investors in Week 3 with a pair of touchdowns and eight catches. Assuming DeSean Jackson (groin) misses Week 4, as is expected, Agholor should be worth at least a fantay flex spot for the short turnaround Thursday at the Packers. However, Green Bay has been one of the stingiest fantasy defenses against receivers (23.6 points-per-game, the second-lowest mark).

The 2015 first-round pick posted a 62/768/8 line during a breakout 2017 season, but his 5.0 OTD suggested touchdown regression to the mean was on tap. Sure enough, the Eagles slot receiver posted a similar 64/743/4 line in 2018 with touchdowns being the notable exception. Agholor still managed a 34th-place finish in fantasy points (he was 23rd in 2017), though half of his four weekly finishes better than 38th came in Weeks 16-17. The 26-year-old still has a role in a good Eagles offense, but he has a lot of competition for targets with DeSean Jackson and J.J.

from a big-play back, but the BYU product has stuck with the Packers and heads into his third season, right behind Aaron Jones on the depth chart. The Bears offer a very tough matchup and Williams isn't the most efficenct back in the first place, though, so Week 1 isn't the best time to try to sneak him into a flex spot.","2":"Williams is definitely in a timeshare with Aaron Jones in the Green Bay backfield, but he seems to be squarely in the No. 2 position on the depth chart. Jones played on more snaps and saw eight more carries, even though Williams did manage two catches and targets (compared to just one for Jones). The Packers go from one tough divisional matchup to another in Week 2, facing a Vikings team that limited Devonta Freeman to 19 yards on eight rushes in Week 1. Keep Williams on your fantasy bench in Week 2.","3":"Williams isn't Green Bay's lead back, but that doesn't disqualify him from fantasy consideration. He's seeing just under 50% of the Packers' offensive snaps and has been targeted in the passing game six times while picking up 14 carries. That said, the Green Bay matchups  have been very difficult for the first two weeks, and that remains true in Week 3. As such, Williams' lack of efficiency and production is likely to continue. He's a risky flex play best left on benches in most leagues.","4":"It can be difficult to make sense of the Packers backfield, as Williams leap-frogged Aaron Jones in terms of playing time in Week 3 after being out-snapped in Weeks 1 and 2. Williams also had a better performance in Week 3 in terms of yards-per-carry, yet both of the rushing touchdowns from the duo came from Jones. It's safe to say we're unlikely to see either back pull away from the other any time soon. For now, both can be viewed as partners in what should be an improving offense. In Week 4, however, they face the Eagles, one of the best defenses against the run so far this season. With that in mind, Williams is just a flex option."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":0.03715170278637771,"averageDraftPosition":168.6604717059755,"percentChange":15.366427332546007,"percentOwned":28.985109971755012,"percentStarted":8.28510135657107},"proTeamId":9,"rankings":{"0":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":46,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":44,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":47,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":49.166666666666664,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2}],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":43,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":49,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":43,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":50,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":45,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":49,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":45,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":47,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":45.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":47.333333333333336,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":45,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":40,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":38,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":40,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":42,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":37,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":41,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":40,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":39,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":43,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":41.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":39.666666666666664,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":42,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":61,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":23}]},"seasonOutlook":"Williams has struggled with efficiency during his first two NFL seasons, but he has still managed to register 921 snaps and 326 touches during that span. The 2017 fourth-round pick increased his rookie-season 3.6 YPC to 3.8 in 2018, but his YAC fell from 1.9 to 1.7. That is despite facing extremely light boxes both seasons. Williams has also ranked near the bottom of the position in catch rate (73 percent) on 71 career targets. Though he'll sustain a role in the Packers' backfield, Williams won't see enough volume to allow fantasy relevance as long as the more effective Aaron Jones is healthy.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":7.664783171562501,"appliedStats":{"53":12.563955755,"72":-0.740424158,"24":56.06413931,"25":24.452243531999997,"26":0.320605556,"42":21.930521260000003,"43":7.931999268,"44":0.095119704,"63":0.018370518},"appliedTotal":122.63653074500002,"externalId":"2018","id":"102018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":140.2286041,"24":560.6413931,"25":4.075373922,"26":0.160302778,"27":112.0,"28":56.0,"29":28.0,"30":22.0,"31":11.0,"32":5.0,"33":28.0,"34":14.0,"35":0.279010153,"36":0.195307107,"37":0.899469227,"38":0.030695434,"39":3.9980530127804355,"40":37.22100535,"41":25.12791151,"42":219.3052126,"43":1.321999878,"44":0.047559852,"45":0.080429615,"46":0.052560753,"47":43.0,"48":21.0,"49":10.0,"50":8.0,"51":4.0,"52":2.0,"53":25.12791151,"54":5.0,"55":2.0,"56":0.082787437,"57":0.002560436,"58":32.96679401,"60":8.727554317943394,"61":14.55968216,"62":0.207862631,"63":0.003061753,"66":0.66068268,"67":0.118389369,"68":0.779072048,"70":0.303914033,"71":0.066298046,"72":0.370212079,"73":0.370212079,"210":16.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":0.5},"appliedTotal":0.5,"externalId":"401127863","id":"01401127863","proTeamId":9,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"210":1.0,"53":1.0,"41":1.0,"58":1.0,"59":1.0,"156":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":6.223702271,"appliedStats":{"53":10.230842785,"101":0.069945882,"72":-0.580866712,"24":44.4336586,"25":16.558617654000003,"26":0.212430534,"42":16.84642307,"43":5.483865156,"44":0.086223408,"63":0.014393688000000002},"appliedTotal":93.355534065,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":109.0986234,"24":444.336586,"25":2.759769609,"26":0.106215267,"27":88.0,"28":44.0,"29":22.0,"30":17.0,"31":8.0,"33":21.0,"34":10.0,"35":0.212788713,"36":0.148952099,"37":0.544345487,"38":0.018576423,"39":4.072797367,"40":29.49952438,"42":168.4642307,"43":0.913977526,"44":0.043111704,"45":0.065190557,"46":0.042602029,"47":33.0,"48":16.0,"49":8.0,"50":6.0,"51":3.0,"53":20.46168557,"54":4.0,"55":2.0,"56":0.063527134,"57":0.001964757,"58":26.65521801,"60":8.23315509,"61":11.18434727,"62":0.149326971,"63":0.002398948,"66":0.514014749,"67":0.096404591,"68":0.610419341,"70":0.236446785,"71":0.053986571,"72":0.290433356,"73":0.290433356,"101":0.011657647,"114":43.71617647,"116":4.0,"117":1.0,"210":15.0625}},{"appliedStats":{"53":1.163372979,"72":-0.075415156,"24":3.635288273,"25":1.6211581980000003,"26":0.018539416,"42":1.912756966,"43":0.627030936,"44":0.010471588,"63":0.0018539999999999997},"appliedTotal":8.915057200000001,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":9.595016794,"24":36.35288273,"25":0.270193033,"26":0.009269708,"27":7.0,"28":3.0,"29":1.0,"30":1.0,"33":1.0,"35":0.019157955,"36":0.013410568,"37":0.0577,"38":0.00197,"39":3.788725284,"40":36.35288273,"42":19.12756966,"43":0.104505156,"44":0.005235794,"45":0.004131996,"46":0.00270026,"47":3.0,"48":1.0,"53":2.326745958,"56":0.008499203,"57":2.62862E-4,"58":2.998321535,"60":8.220738319,"61":19.12756966,"62":0.014505502,"63":3.09E-4,"66":0.06328927,"67":0.015347347,"68":0.078636617,"70":0.029113064,"71":0.008594514,"72":0.037707578,"73":0.037707578,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":1.063597946,"72":-0.06604954,"24":3.314115451,"25":1.181347452,"26":0.014738584,"42":1.7252856200000002,"43":0.645453966,"44":0.010297054,"63":0.00162},"appliedTotal":7.890406532999999,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":8.294597915,"24":33.14115451,"25":0.196891242,"26":0.007369292,"27":6.0,"28":3.0,"29":1.0,"30":1.0,"33":1.0,"35":0.016378504,"36":0.011464953,"37":0.047936557,"38":0.001635891,"39":3.995510675,"40":33.14115451,"42":17.2528562,"43":0.107575661,"44":0.005148527,"45":0.003919465,"46":0.00256137,"47":3.0,"48":1.0,"53":2.127195892,"56":0.007107226,"57":2.19811E-4,"58":2.738170098,"60":8.110609964,"61":17.2528562,"62":0.012517819,"63":2.7E-4,"66":0.054711634,"67":0.014031104,"68":0.068742737,"70":0.025167352,"71":0.007857418,"72":0.03302477,"73":0.03302477,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":1.0,"24":5.9,"42":2.7},"appliedTotal":9.600000000000001,"externalId":"401127925","id":"01401127925","proTeamId":9,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":12.0,"24":59.0,"27":11.0,"28":5.0,"29":2.0,"30":2.0,"31":1.0,"33":2.0,"34":1.0,"39":4.917,"40":59.0,"41":2.0,"42":27.0,"47":5.0,"48":2.0,"49":1.0,"50":1.0,"53":2.0,"58":2.0,"59":28.0,"60":13.5,"61":27.0,"155":1.0,"210":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":8.798121131846155,"appliedStats":{"53":15.23926492,"72":-0.96241734,"24":48.24949246,"25":18.876064878,"26":0.22294359,"42":24.98653282,"43":7.614297113999999,"44":0.125759638,"63":0.023636634000000004},"appliedTotal":114.3755747140000

was fantasy's No. 7 kicker in 2018 after finishing 16th or worse each of the previous three seasons. He attempted 37 field goals, which tied for his second most in a single season in his 12-year career. Crosby has benefited from plenty of opportunity in Green Bay's high-scoring offense, but efficiency has eluded him nearly his entire career. He made 30 of 37 attempts last season (81.1 percent) and, in terms of expected conversion rate based on distance, Crosby has been below average in nine of 12 seasons, including each of the past three. Crosby is a fringe fantasy starter and loses some value in leagues that dock for misses.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":7.692173872874999,"appliedStats":{"80":45.209766720000005,"85":-5.32785986,"86":40.82507164,"74":14.026720450000001,"77":28.341083016},"appliedTotal":123.07478196599999,"externalId":"2018","id":"102018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"74":2.80534409,"75":4.585663298,"76":1.7803192079999999,"77":7.085270754,"78":9.192528474,"79":2.10725772,"80":15.06992224,"81":16.51020518,"82":1.4402829399999995,"83":24.96053709,"84":30.28839695,"85":5.32785986,"86":40.82507164,"87":44.48318748,"88":3.6581158400000007,"210":16.0}},{"appliedStats":{"80":6.0,"86":3.0},"appliedTotal":9.0,"externalId":"401127863","id":"01401127863","proTeamId":9,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"80":2.0,"81":2.0,"210":1.0,"83":2.0,"84":2.0,"86":3.0,"87":3.0,"108":1.0,"156":1.0,"109":1.0,"158":9.0}},{"appliedAverage":8.215398845500001,"appliedStats":{"80":49.934767859999994,"85":-5.640135117,"86":40.16181454,"74":15.759258425,"77":31.23067582},"appliedTotal":131.44638152800002,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"74":3.151851685,"75":5.083096034,"76":1.93124435,"77":7.807668955,"78":10.14292086,"79":2.335251909,"80":16.64492262,"81":18.01856148,"82":1.373638859,"83":27.60444326,"84":33.24457838,"85":5.640135117,"86":40.16181454,"87":43.37759789,"88":3.215783352,"198":3.151851685,"199":5.083096034,"200":1.93124435,"210":16.0}},{"appliedStats":{"80":3.2663237819999997,"85":-0.389302132,"86":2.537294904,"74":1.026516155,"77":2.039353788},"appliedTotal":8.480186497,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"74":0.205303231,"75":0.335343094,"76":0.130039863,"77":0.509838447,"78":0.669150935,"79":0.159312488,"80":1.088774594,"81":1.188724375,"82":0.099949781,"83":1.803916273,"84":2.193218405,"85":0.389302132,"86":2.537294904,"87":2.763882238,"88":0.226587334,"198":0.205303231,"199":0.335343094,"200":0.130039863}},{"appliedStats":{"80":3.209660787,"85":-0.362531384,"86":2.50342838,"74":1.012959025,"77":2.007416472},"appliedTotal":8.37093328,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"74":0.202591805,"75":0.326726542,"76":0.124134737,"77":0.501854118,"78":0.651957278,"79":0.150103161,"80":1.069886929,"81":1.158180416,"82":0.088293487,"83":1.774332851,"84":2.136864236,"85":0.362531384,"86":2.50342838,"87":2.703879565,"88":0.200451185,"198":0.202591805,"199":0.326726542,"200":0.124134737}},{"appliedStats":{"85":-1.0,"86":3.0,"77":8.0},"appliedTotal":10.0,"externalId":"401127925","id":"01401127925","proTeamId":9,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"77":2.0,"78":3.0,"79":1.0,"83":2.0,"84":3.0,"85":1.0,"86":3.0,"87":3.0,"155":1.0,"158":9.0,"210":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":7.559613490307693,"appliedStats":{"80":37.20860394,"85":-4.434768203,"86":30.57602255,"74":11.693645715,"77":23.231471372},"appliedTotal":98.27497537400001,"externalId":"2019","id":"122019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{"74":2.338729143,"75":3.820089252,"76":1.48136011,"77":5.807867843,"78":7.622689541,"79":1.814821698,"80":12.40286798,"81":13.54145438,"82":1.138586396,"83":20.54946497,"84":24.98423317,"85":4.434768203,"86":30.57602255,"87":33.3065445,"88":2.730521953,"198":2.338729143,"199":3.820089252,"200":1.48136011,"210":13.0}},{"appliedAverage":8.625,"appliedStats":{"80":42.0,"85":-7.0,"86":34.0,"74":25.0,"77":44.0},"appliedTotal":138.0,"externalId":"2018","id":"002018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"58":1.0,"74":5.0,"75":7.0,"76":2.0,"77":11.0,"78":15.0,"79":4.0,"80":14.0,"81":15.0,"82":1.0,"83":30.0,"84":37.0,"85":7.0,"86":34.0,"87":36.0,"88":2.0,"155":6.0,"156":9.0,"157":1.0,"174":0.375,"210":16.0}},{"appliedAverage":6.5,"appliedStats":{"80":9.0,"85":-1.0,"86":10.0,"77":8.0},"appliedTotal":26.0,"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"108":1.0,"77":2.0,"109":1.0,"78":3.0,"79":1.0,"80":3.0,"81":3.0,"210":4.0,"83":5.0,"84":6.0,"85":1.0,"86":10.0,"87":10.0,"155":3.0,"156":1.0,"158":25.0}}],"universeId":2},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":10,"totalRanking":143,"totalRating":26.0}},"rosterLocked":true,"status":"ONTEAM","tradeLocked":false},"status":"NORMAL"}]},"tradeBlock":{},"transactionCounter":{"acquisitionBudgetSpent":26,"acquisitions":11,"drops":11,"matchupAcquisitionTotals":{"2":2,"3":3,"4":2},"misc":0,"moveToActive":18,"moveToIR":0,"paid":0.0,"teamCharges":0.0,"trades":0},"valuesByStat":{"128":0.0,"129":0.0,"130":2.0,"4":6.0,"132":1.0,"133":0.0,"134":0.0,"135":0.0,"8":31.0,"72":2.0,"136":0.0,"74":0.0,"

squashed any doubts from his productive rookie season by finding the end zone 18 times, matching his 81-reception debut and piling up 883 yards on 74 more carries than in his first go-around. The agile back looks primed for another top-end RB1 fantasy season. Even a moderately difficult matchup like the Texans shouldn't prevent fantasy managers from parking him in Week 1 lineups.","2":"Kamara recorded 20 touches and 169 scrimmage yards in Week 1, averaging 7.5 yards-per-carry and 9.0 yards-per-target. One of the top picks in most fantasy drafts, the third-year ball carrier is once again set for a RB1 tier fantasy ranking in Week 2 against the Rams in what is expected to be a high-scoring clash.","3":"The thumb injury that forced Drew Brees to exit Week 2 could throw off the entire Saints offense if he's going to miss 6-to-8 weeks. Kamara struggled after Brees left the game last week and probably will face many stacked boxes while the Hall of Famer is out. Teddy Bridgewater and Taysom Hill should improve with more prep, but their presence under center limits New Orleans' fantasy upside. That being said, Kamara's value may not dip too harshly in PPR fantasy leagues as he may be relied on for plenty of short routes and after-the-catch production. He's still a low-end fantasy RB1 against Seattle.","4":"Kamara recorded 25 touches -- his highest count on the season -- in Week 3, the team's first without Drew Brees (thumb). Expect the Saints to continue having their top back take pressure off QB Teddy Bridgewater with busy workloads. This added security, combined with his elite talent, keeps Kamara in fantasy RB1 territory for Week 4 against the Cowboys, who rank in the middle of the league with 23.2 RB fantasy points allowed per game."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":52.78018575851393,"averageDraftPosition":4.865794735088304,"percentChange":0.01263678542954949,"percentOwned":99.9231757807911,"percentStarted":99.64442988811004},"proTeamId":18,"rankings":{"0":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":2.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":2.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":3.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":2.6666666666666665,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":5.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":5.166666666666667,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":3.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankTyp

as efficient a season as you'll find for any running back (let alone a rookie) in 2017, Kamara's 2018 went about as expected: He regressed to the mean, but still played at a high level and was a terrific fantasy asset. The former third-round pick finished top-eight among backs in snaps (628), touches (275), scrimmage yards (1592), offensive touchdowns (18) and fantasy points (354). Kamara has yet to clear 200 carries in a season, but he has caught 81 passes in both of his NFL seasons and saw a significant uptick in work near the goal line last season (his 14.5 OTD ranked second in the league).

hindered Evans this preseason but, barring a rapid change in the coming days, he looks ready to play against the 49ers. Evans marked a career high with 1,524 yards last year with a ridiculous 11.0 yards-per-target average. QB Jameis Winston has had to learn Bruce Arians' offense, but mastering it would offer a similarly lofty ceiling for the experienced 26-year-old wideout, who remains a low-end fantasy WR1 for Week 1.","2":"Evans was seemingly hindered by an illness in Week 1, registering just 28 receiving yards against the 49ers. Still, Jameis Winston looked ugly running this new offense, so perhaps it's not all Evans' fault. Still, it does hinder his upside against the Panthers in Week 2 on Thursday. Consider him to be more of a fantasy WR2 until Winston shows more comfort slinging the rock.","3":"Evans has dealt with an illness and the emergence of Chris Godwin in a quiet two-game start to 2019. Still, he's in a prime position to rebound. The Giants, Tampa Bay's Week 3 opponents, have allowed a league-high 550 WR receiving yards. Expect a breakthrough performance from the deep threat as a borderline fantasy WR1.","4":"Evans caught three scores against the Giants including his season-long catch of 55-yards. He saw 15 targets and 12.7 yards-per-target, living up to his big-play reputation. However, awaiting in Week 4 is the Rams defense, which has allowed the sixth-fewest WR fantasy points-per-game. Of course, considering Evans can break one off at any time, he's still at least a fantasy WR2."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":31.61919504643963,"averageDraftPosition":25.532538955087077,"percentChange":0.4344051918675689,"percentOwned":99.4435742257031,"percentStarted":92.36169455322178},"proTeamId":27,"rankings":{"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":7.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":6.833333333333333,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"2":[],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":11.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":12.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":21,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":21,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":21,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":8.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":8.333333333333334,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":29,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":21,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23}]},"seasonOutlook":"Evans has finished no lower than 11th in targets, no lower than 12th in receiving yardage and no lower than eighth in OTD among wide receivers during each of the past four seasons.

Evans ranked third among receivers in both YPR (17.7) and YPT (11.0) and sits second in the NFL with 88 end zone targets since entering the league. The 6-foot-5 25-year-old is a fringe

for the team's Hard Knocks experience during camp. The top back selected in April's draft, Jacobs is likely to consume the majority of touches out of the Oakland backfield to begin the season. The Broncos were gashed badly on the ground last season in allowing nearly 4.8 yards per carry to tailbacks, supporting solid RB2 expectations for Jacobs in his professional debut.","2":"All Jacobs did in his first NFL game was tally 113 scrimmage yards and two touchdowns, becoming the first player since LaDainian Tomlinson in 2001 with 100 yards from scrimmage and two rushing scores in his debut. The Chiefs present an inviting matchup for this promising RB2 this week, as Kansas City has allowed 4.96 yards per carry to tailbacks since the start of last season, the highest rate in the league over this sample.","3":"Volume is a great quality for a feature back in fantasy football. Jacobs is one of only 14 players currently averaging at least 18 touches this season. The Green Bay backfield got untracked against this Vikings defense last week, but it's unclear if this Oakland offense can move the ball as capably as the Packers last week. Given the difficult road matchup and some wear and tear already affecting the rookie, Jacobs is in the flex discussion for Week 3.","4":"Jacobs has been solid when given the ball, but since he's isolated to rushing work almost exclusively, his fantasy profile suffers somewhat in PPR formats. There is talk of getting Jacobs more targets, but until we see them, he's a solid RB2 given his rushing production and this matchup with a banged-up Colts front."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":25.479876160990713,"averageDraftPosition":41.3107815364106,"percentChange":-0.558117831196256,"percentOwned":98.10387668648322,"percentStarted":78.67060624399274},"proTeamId":13,"rankings":{"0":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2}],"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":16.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":15.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":11.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":9.666666666666666,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":20,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":17,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":16.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":17.166666666666668,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":17,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":17,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":47,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":20,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":47,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":4

has a new feature back after selecting Jacobs with the No. 24 overall pick in April's draft. Jacobs has a solid frame (5-foot-10, 220 pounds) and is a terrific rusher, good receiver and even offers value as a kick returner. The Alabama product lacks top-end speed, but is quick, elusive and strong. Jacobs broke one tackle for every 6.1 touches last season, which was best among backs who attended the combine. Jacobs has the skill set to quickly step in as a three-down back in the pros and, aside from deferring some work to Jalen Richard in passing situations, he figures to play that full-time role right out of the gate. Jacobs shouldn't have trouble pushing for 250 touches as a rookie and should be viewed as an RB2 in season-long leagues.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":14.089748280200006,"appliedStats":{"53":21.871756145,"72":-2.494688448,"24":102.69012580000002,"25":43.060709681999995,"26":0.586688822,"42":35.925423710000004,"43":9.493278294,"44":0.15110318,"63":0.061827018},"appliedTotal":211.34622420300008,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":234.5148192,"24":1026.901258,"25":7.176784947,"26":0.293344411,"27":205.0,"28":102.0,"29":51.0,"30":41.0,"31":20.0,"33":46.0,"34":23.0,"35":0.488566888,"36":0.341996822,"37":2.904592426,"38":0.099122596,"39":4.378833124,"40":68.17601714,"42":359.2542371,"43":1.582213049,"44":0.07555159,"45":0.070627747,"46":0.046155233,"47":71.0,"48":35.0,"49":17.0,"50":14.0,"51":7.0,"53":43.74351229,"54":8.0,"55":4.0,"56":0.189237235,"57":0.005852698,"58":55.60855576,"60":8.212743292,"61":23.85090371,"62":0.368896001,"63":0.010304503,"66":2.209818462,"67":0.412192378,"68":2.62201084,"70":1.016516492,"71":0.230827732,"72":1.247344224,"73":1.247344224,"210":15.0625}},{"appliedStats":{"24":4.4},"appliedTotal":4.4,"externalId":"401127956","id":"01401127956","proTeamId":13,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":10.0,"24":44.0,"27":8.0,"28":4.0,"29":2.0,"30":1.0,"33":2.0,"34":1.0,"39":4.4,"40":44.0,"58":2.0,"156":1.0,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":0.8093041895,"72":-0.165742914,"24":7.298917712,"25":2.68870407,"26":0.034150972,"42":1.307243726,"43":0.232831476,"44":0.003955188,"63":0.00417},"appliedTotal":12.213534419500002,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":17.14832925,"24":72.98917712,"25":0.448117345,"26":0.017075486,"27":14.0,"28":7.0,"29":3.0,"30":2.0,"31":1.0,"33":3.0,"34":1.0,"35":0.03643637,"36":0.025505459,"37":0.233162712,"38":0.007956949,"39":4.256343348,"40":72.98917712,"42":13.07243726,"43":0.038805246,"44":0.001977594,"45":0.004017382,"46":0.002625359,"47":2.0,"48":1.0,"53":1.618608379,"56":0.00489266,"57":1.51319E-4,"58":2.062692459,"60":8.076343498,"61":13.07243726,"62":0.01905308,"63":6.95E-4,"66":0.161587633,"67":0.015252045,"68":0.176839679,"70":0.074330311,"71":0.008541145,"72":0.082871457,"73":0.082871457,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":0.8653726185,"72":-0.15847468,"24":6.84612011,"25":2.8244830260000002,"26":0.031678154,"42":1.313206359,"43":0.19488460800000001,"44":0.00362797,"63":0.003978},"appliedTotal":11.9248761655,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":16.17340802,"24":68.4612011,"25":0.470747171,"26":0.015839077,"27":13.0,"28":6.0,"29":3.0,"30":2.0,"31":1.0,"33":3.0,"34":1.0,"35":0.034097425,"36":0.023868198,"37":0.205099541,"38":0.007,"39":4.232948368,"40":68.4612011,"42":13.13206359,"43":0.032480768,"44":0.001813985,"45":0.00325148,"46":0.002124842,"47":2.0,"48":1.0,"53":1.730745237,"56":0.004917402,"57":1.52085E-4,"58":2.180825607,"60":7.587519706,"61":13.13206359,"62":0.017653062,"63":6.63E-4,"66":0.152401011,"67":0.016308704,"68":0.168709715,"70":0.070104465,"71":0.009132874,"72":0.07923734,"73":0.07923734,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":1.0,"24":7.9,"42":2.9000000000000004},"appliedTotal":11.8,"externalId":"401128030","id":"01401128030","proTeamId":13,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"33":3.0,"34":1.0,"39":4.647,"40":79.0,"41":2.0,"42":29.0,"47":5.0,"48":2.0,"49":1.0,"210":1.0,"50":1.0,"53":2.0,"23":17.0,"24":79.0,"58":2.0,"59":25.0,"27":15.0,"155":1.0,"60":14.5,"28":7.0,"61":29.0,"29":3.0,"30":3.0,"31":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":12.855911752999999,"appliedStats":{"53":10.388004665,"72":-2.198656424,"24":97.56642455000001,"25":40.950421746,"26":0.500304022,"42":16.51317177,"43":3.295722186,"44":0.056111294,"63":0.05534898},"appliedTotal":167.126852789,"externalId":"2019","id":"122019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{"23":228.3273135,"24":975.6642455,"25":6.825070291,"26":0.250152011,"27":195.0,"28":97.0,"29":48.0,"30":39.0,"31":19.0,"33":45.0,"34":22.0,"35":0.486969425,"36":0.340878598,"37":3.218481366,"38":0.109834421,"39":4.273094755,"40":75.05109581,"42":165.1317177,"43":0.549287031,"44":0.028055647,"45":0.050415881,"46":0.032946778,"47":33.0,"48":16.0,"49":8.0,"50":6.0,"51":3.0,"53":20.77600933,"54":4.0,"55":2.0,"56":0.061708485,"57":0.00190851,"58":26.30066235,"60":7.948192315,"61":12.70243982,"62":0.278207658,"63":0.00922483,"66":2.151513983,"67":0.195771035,"68":2.347285018,"70":0.989696432,"71":0.10963178,"72":1.099328212,"73":1.099328212,"210":13.0}},{"appliedAverage":12.699999999999998,"appliedStats":{"53":0.5,"24":22.8,"25":12.0,"42":2.8000000000000003},"appliedTotal":38.099999999999994,"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"

has settled in Los Angeles, getting off to a flying start in his first full season with the Rams. Cooks set a career-high for receiving yards in 2018 and is poised to meet or exceed that figure now that he's built some rapport with Jared Goff. The Panthers allowed the eighth-most fantasy points to wideouts a year ago, making Cooks an easy pick as a WR2 for Week 1.","2":"Among the \"big three\" at receiver for the Rams, Cooks was surpassed by both Robert Woods and Cooper Kupp in Week 1. The former Saint and Patriot saw only six targets, compared to the 23 shared between his position-mates, and he caught just two of them for 39 yards. He was on the field for almost every offensive snap, so his playing time isn't the question. This just seems to be an issue of QB Jared Goff having too many mouths to feed in the offense. This may happen from time to time, but don't let it shake your confidence. Cooks is a WR2 in all formats in Week 2.","3":"The Rams may have three elite receivers in Cooks, Robert Woods and Cooper Kupp, but the former Saint and Patriot is certainly the one with the most big-play potential. He put that on display in Week 2, hauling in a long TD pass from Jared Goff to help fantasy managers forget about a rough Week 1 outing. Cooks is a threat to have a massive score in any given week -- and that includes Week 3 against the Browns. Cleveland allowed Tennessee to pass for three scores in Week 1, so there's no reason to downgrade Cooks at all. He's a WR2 you can start with confidence.","4":"Cooks had a bit of a breakout in Week 3, seeing 12 targets and hauling in eight of them for a respectable 112 yards. Yet he was kept out of the end zone, limiting his fantasy performance to \"good\" and not \"great.\" Since most drafted him to be great, they'll be hoping for things to change in Week 4 against Tampa Bay. The Buccaneers struggled against rookie Daniel Jones and the Giants in Week 3 and should provide Cooks with opportunities to get open and gain yards. He's a WR2 for this week's fantasy slate."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":18.561919504643964,"averageDraftPosition":44.60288357363114,"percentChange":-0.16254251953793641,"percentOwned":98.4462274219536,"percentStarted":80.91678491609571},"proTeamId":14,"rankings":{"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":12.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":12.833333333333334,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":11.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":12.333333333333334,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":24,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":21,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":24,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":26,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":17.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":21.166666666666668,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":20,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":21,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":20,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":46,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":22,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":46,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":17,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":46,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank

bouncing all over the league in recent years, Cooks has put together four consecutive top 15 fantasy campaigns. He has ranked no lower than 11th in pass routes or 13th in receiving yards during the span. Though he's known for his speed and vertical presence, Cooks has ranked near the top of the position in screens and carries during the past two seasons. He has been about as efficient as you could reasonably expect, ranking no worse than 11th in yards per target each of the past three seasons. During the seven full games Cooks, Robert Woods and Cooper Kupp played together last season, Cooks handled a strong 23 percent target share (7.7 per game) and ranked ninth in fantasy points.

short of 5,000 in 2018 and ranks as one of fantasy's top quarterbacks once again. A big play in his favor is that Atlanta plays 13 of its 16 games indoors in 2019. That'll be the case in Week 1 , though it comes, unfortunately, at a tough Vikings defense. Still, with Julio Jones, Calvin Ridley, Austin Hooper and a healthy Devonta Freeman, Ryan has a group of talented receivers who'll keep him steadily among the QB1 fantasy rankings most weeks. Feel free to keep him there even in this difficult assignment.","2":"Ryan posted garbage-time volume in Week 1, topping 300 passing yards and accounting for two passing scores. He should feel more comfortable at home in Week 2 against the Eagles, who just allowed Washington's Case Keenum to post a career-high in passing yards against them in the opener. Despite his disappointing kickoff to 2019, Ryan deserves steady QB1 trust for Week 2 fantasy lineups.","3":"Despite having thrown five interceptions over his first two games, Ryan has also put five tallies in the TD column. The Colts have kept opposing quarterbacks in check, but the last one was Detroit's Matthew Stafford, which helped their numbers. Ryan will play indoors for the third straight game to open the season, which propels this high-octane offense. He'll again rank as a solid fantasy QB1 in Week 3.","4":"Week 3 marked Ryan's second straight game with three passing scores and the third with 300-plus passing yards. He has also increased his YPA each time, culminating at 8.9 at the Colts on Sunday. Atlanta is at home in Week 4, where Ryan has typically perfored better. The Titans have allowed six TD passes so far and, while they're among the tougher fantasy matchups for quarterbacks, Ryan still deserves the trust of a low-end fantasy QB1 this Sunday."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":3.9489164086687305,"averageDraftPosition":66.4925012497917,"percentChange":-0.5129437437961002,"percentOwned":97.15330291410496,"percentStarted":67.05876052355347},"proTeamId":1,"rankings":{"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":11.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":11.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":5.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":5.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":8.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":8.166666666666666,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":7.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":7.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}]},"seasonOutlook":"Perhaps one of the league's most underrated players, Ryan has ranked ninth or better in completions, passing yards and completion percentage each of the past seven seasons. Last season, Ryan finished second at the position in fantasy points for the second time in three seasons. He will be reunited with offensive coordinator Dirk Koetter. Ryan finished top five in the NFL in passing yards during each of Koetter's previous three seasons with Atlanta (2012-14). Ryan doesn't add much with his legs (though he did add three rushing scores along with 35 passing touchdowns last season), but he's never short on top-end volume and efficiency. Especially with a terrific wide receiver trio and solid offensive line, Ryan is positioned for another top-five fantasy campaign.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":16.897158734625002,"appliedStats":{"19":1.773512282,"4":107.21256708,"20":-20.86122786,"8":172.0,"72":-6.24302458,"24":10.757889380000002,"25":5.517994452,"26":0.043144064,"63":0.153684936},"appliedTotal":270.35453975400003,"externalId":"2018","id":"102018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":550.4300429,"1":357.0566083,"2":193.3734346,"3":4300.478808,"4":26.80314177,"5":860.0,"6":430.0,"7":215.0,"8":172.0,"9":86.0,"10":43.0,"11":71.0,"12":35.0,"13":38.0,"14":19.0,"15":3.857054205,"16":2.520584923,"17":4.766219573,"18":0.643791293,"19":0.886756141,"20":10.43061393,"21":0.648686628,"22":270.045765,"23":32.67586195,"24":107.5788938,"25":0.919665742,"26":0.021572032,"27":21.0,"28":10.0,"29":5.0,"30":4.0,"31":2.0,"32":1.0,"33":6.0,"34":3.0,"35":0.061056565,"36":0.042739595,"37":0.030984597,"38":0.001057385,"39":3.292304697718923,"40":6.755346552,"62":0.908328173,"63":0.025614156,"64":31.14835197,"65":6.170886851,"66":0.346710003,"68":6.517596854,"69":2.962025689,"70":0.159486601,"72":3.12151229,"73":13.55212622,"210":16.0}},{"appliedAverage":20.255367817333333,"appliedStats":{"19":2.824810734,"4":123.00024848,"20":-15.993146714,"8":183.0,"72":-7.934810652,"24":11.650318660000002,"25":6.99155775,"26":0.096201886,"63":0.195337116},"appliedTotal":303.83051726,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":572.9799725,"1":390.4257422,"2":182.5542303,"3":4596.161383,"4":30.75006212,"5":919.0,"6":459.0,"7":229.0,"8":183.0,"9":91.0,"10":45.0,"11":78.0,"12":39.0,"15":4.36940576,"16":2.855406664,"17":6.218570104,"18":0.839965769,"19":1.412405367,"20":7.996573357,"21":0.681395094,"22":292.7491327,"23":34.88664588,"24":116.5031866,"25":1.165259625,"26":0.048100943,"27":23.0,"28":11.0,"29":5.0,"30":4.0,"31":2.0,"33":6.0,"34":3.0,"35":0.065269341,"36":0.045688538,"37":0.036552216,"38":0.001247387,"39":3.339478005,"40":7.420585133,"62":1.460506309,"63":0.032556186,"64":39.91984575,"65":7.837879729,"66":0.446137079,"68":8.284016808,"69":3.76218227,"70":0.205223056,"72":3.967405326,"73":11.96397868,"210":15.7}},{"appliedStats":{"19":0.171811598,"4":7.917315368,"20":-1.926319178,"8":11.0,"72":-0.390477046,"24":0.8309790956,"25":0.39402274800000003,"26":0.006254314,"63":0.009600000000000001},"appliedTotal":18.013186899599997,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"0":36.40283974,"1":24.95758584,"2":11.4452539,"3":287.5398044,"4":1.979328842,"5":57.0,"6":28.0,"7":14.0,"8":11.0,"9":5.0,"10":2.0,"11":4.0,"12":2.0,"15":0.273106671,"16":0.17847521,"17":0.385525772,"18":0.052074423,"19":0.085905799,"20":0.963159589,"21":0.685594476,"22":287.5398044,"23":2.307460362,"24":8.309790956,"25":0.065670458,"26":0.003127157,"27":1.0,"35":0.004321976,"36":0.003025383,"37":0.00297,"38":1.01E-4,"39":3.601271377,"40":8.309790956,"62":0.089032956,"63":0.0016,"64":2.133077487,"65":0.384673128,"66":0.023033525,"68":0.407706653,"69":0.184643102,"70":0.010595421,"72":0.195238523,"73":1.158398112,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"19":0.15751589,"4":6.917105304,"20":-1.615527184,"8":11.0,"72":-0.402491098,"24":0.7706957141,"25":0.40678887,"26":0.005827494,"63":0.00990864},"appliedTotal":17.249823630099996,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"0":37.25768361,"1":25.00579514,"2":12.25188846,"3":290.6831771,"4":1.729276326,"5":58.0,"6":29.0,"7":14.0,"8":11.0,"9":5.0,"10":2.0,"11":5.0,"12":2.0,"15":0.278728613,"16":0.182149149,"17":0.402583689,"18":0.0543785,"19":0.078757945,"20":0.807763592,"21":0.671158073,"22":290.6831771,"23":2.279196325,"24":7.706957141,"25":0.067798145,"26":0.002913747,"27":1.0,"35":0.004267944,"36":0.002987561,"37":0.00254863,"38":8.7E-5,"39":3.381436279,"40":7.706957141,"62":0.081671693,"63":0.00165144,"64":2.376600204,"65":0.397363039,"66":0.022850631,"68":0.42021367,"69":0.190734259,"70":0.01051129,"72":0.201245549,"73":1.009009141,"210":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":21.04128131983333,"appliedStats":{"19":2.334585514,"4":109.15446028,"20":-22.08847756,"8":152.0,"72":-5.190539264,"24":10.74355641,"25":5.326599576,"26":0.087405678,"63":0.12778520399999999},"appliedTotal":252.49537583799997,"externalId":"2019","id":"122019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{"0":483.0426906,"1":331.1712473,"2":151.8714433,"3":3801.057511,"4":27.28861507,"5":760.0,"6":380.0,"7":190.0,"8":152.0,"9":76.0,"10":38.0,"11":66.0,"12":33.0,"15":3.667132744,"16":2.396471248,"17":5.394284606,"18":0.728626411,"19":1.167292757,"20":11.04423878,"21":0.685594159,"22":293.7447844,"23":29.83267654,"24":107.4355641,"25":0.887766596,"26":0.043702839,"27":21.0,"28":10.0,"29":5.0,"30":4.0,"31":2.0,"33":5.0,"34":2.0,"35":0.055871944,"36":0.039110361,"37

the ball 99 times last season, but he did enough with those carries (plus his 71 receptions) to rank No. 11 in fantasy scoring among running backs. He's got a different backfield mate in David Montgomery this season, but that just means his role should remain the same. Cohen scored against the Packers in their contest last December, and nothing about the matchup suggests he can't do the same in Week 1. He's a solid flex pick to start the season.","2":"Cohen was the best Chicago running back in Week 1, but that's not saying much. The Bears only managed three points and only made it to the red zone once, but Cohen saw 10 targets in the passing game and hauled in eight of them. He was second on his team in targets behind only estabilshed No. 1 receiver Allen Robinson, but fellow running back Mike Davis was third with seven looks. There's no reason to shy away from Cohen, whose electric moves should be on display against a Broncos defense that failed to impress in a Week 1 loss to Oakland. Consider Cohen a flex consideration in Week 2. ","3":"Cohen is essentially the No. 2 receiver for Chicago, as he and Allen Robinson have seen 35 combined targets. No other player has more than seven. However, unlike Robinson, Cohen's looks in the passing game are short and lack upside, meaning his value is amplified specifically in PPR leagues and quite depressed in leagues that don't award points for catches. With that in mind, PPR players can consider him to be a flex pick in Week 3 against a Washington defense that has struggled to defend the pass this season. Those in non-PPR leagues can bench him.","4":"Cohen doesn't seem poised to see 10 targets-per-week, as his Week 1 performance may have suggested to the optimistic. He's seen only nine looks combined in the two games since. While he has picked up eight carries over that span, it's added up to a rather lackluster fantasy point output. He's still the team's second \"receiver\" from a fantasy perspective, but a tough matchup with Minnesota means his upside is limited. Combined with his poor track record so far this season, he can be downgraded to a flex option or RB3.

That helped overcome underwhelming rushing production. The undersized Cohen has ranked 71st and 70th among 72 qualified backs in YAC and has three total carries inside the 5 in his two NFL seasons. Cohen's role allowed him four top-six fantasy weeks, but also six finishes worse than 33rd. Jordan Howard was replaced by David Montgomery, so 5-foot-6, 190-pound Cohen's situational role is unlikely to change. His limited rushing and goal-line role makes him safest as a fringe top-25 back.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":8.355990476,"appliedStats":{"53":27.50418719,"101":0.41617799999999994,"102":3.7162148459999997,"72":-1.586382522,"24":32.76286894,"25":15.251210862,"26":0.136792166,"42":44.340444860000005,"43":10.980344855999999,"44":0.136668418,"63":0.03732},"appliedTotal":133.695847616,"externalId":"2018","id":"102018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":79.73819917,"24":327.6286894,"25":2.541868477,"26":0.068396083,"27":65.0,"28":32.0,"29":16.0,"30":13.0,"31":6.0,"32":3.0,"33":15.0,"34":7.0,"35":0.152998249,"36":0.107098774,"37":0.293753585,"38":0.010024683,"39":4.108804723586786,"40":21.75128229,"41":55.00837438,"42":443.4044486,"43":1.830057476,"44":0.068334209,"45":0.060053151,"46":0.039244734,"47":88.0,"48":44.0,"49":22.0,"50":17.0,"51":8.0,"52":4.0,"53":55.00837438,"54":11.0,"55":5.0,"56":0.311973706,"57":0.00965,"58":71.43029397,"60":8.060671735851432,"61":29.43763974,"62":0.136730291,"63":0.00622,"66":0.937220644,"67":0.646553152,"68":1.583773796,"70":0.431121496,"71":0.362069765,"72":0.793191261,"73":0.793191261,"101":0.069363,"102":0.619369141,"114":518.4439615,"115":284.8637241,"210":16.0}},{"appliedAverage":10.134400734000002,"appliedStats":{"53":30.22061888,"102":2.50356039,"72":-1.741356538,"24":32.282680410000005,"25":11.235587766,"26":0.138600682,"42":56.780619560000005,"43":20.219926068,"44":0.335130128,"63":0.040643663999999996},"appliedTotal":152.01601101000003,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":73.46670225,"24":322.8268041,"25":1.872597961,"26":0.069300341,"27":64.0,"28":32.0,"29":16.0,"30":12.0,"31":6.0,"33":14.0,"34":7.0,"35":0.140479413,"36":0.098335589,"37":0.28580589,"38":0.009753458,"39":4.394192121,"40":21.43248492,"42":567.8061956,"43":3.369987678,"44":0.167565064,"45":0.111660521,"46":0.072970151,"47":113.0,"48":56.0,"49":28.0,"50":22.0,"51":11.0,"53":60.44123776,"54":12.0,"55":6.0,"56":0.603181036,"57":0.018655084,"58":79.06607047,"60":9.394350888,"61":37.69667689,"62":0.236865405,"63":0.006773944,"66":0.945656142,"67":0.777993649,"68":1.723649791,"70":0.435001826,"71":0.435676443,"72":0.870678269,"73":0.870678269,"102":0.417260065,"115":352.1856452,"118":35.0,"119":14.0,"210":15.0625}},{"appliedStats":{"53":1.0,"24":1.1,"42":0.7000000000000001,"43":6.0},"appliedTotal":8.799999999999999,"externalId":"401128093","id":"01401128093","proTeamId":3,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"33":1.0,"39":2.2,"40":11.0,"41":2.0,"42":7.0,"43":1.0,"47":1.0,"210":1.0,"115":16.0,"53":2.0,"118":1.0,"23":5.0,"24":11.0,"184":1.0,"58":5.0,"59":5.0,"27":2.0,"155":1.0,"60":3.5,"28":1.0,"61":7.0,"158":6.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":2.171153061,"102":0.149039292,"72":-0.085215986,"24":1.3397965100000002,"25":0.423492486,"26":0.004677556,"42":3.5291660460000003,"43":0.86557638,"44":0.015868792,"63":0.001938228},"appliedTotal":8.415492364999999,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":3.098368618,"24":13.3979651,"25":0.070582081,"26":0.002338778,"27":2.0,"28":1.0,"35":0.005844949,"36":0.004091464,"37":0.00778,"38":2.65E-4,"39":4.324199846,"40":13.3979651,"42":35.29166046,"43":0.14426273,"44":0.007934396,"45":0.003470351,"46":0.002267874,"47":7.0,"48":3.0,"49":1.0,"50":1.0,"53":4.342306122,"56":0.036950195,"57":0.00114279,"58":5.766972785,"60":8.127400388,"61":35.29166046,"62":0.010273174,"63":3.23038E-4,"66":0.034227972,"67":0.047969867,"68":0.082197839,"70":0.015744867,"71":0.026863126,"72":0.042607993,"73":0.042607993,"102":0.024839882,"115":21.33397059,"118":2.0,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":2.13371776,"102":0.150087582,"72":-0.08516781,"24":1.3580826480000001,"25":0.44744510400000004,"26":0.005689944,"42":3.5909860879999997,"43":1.479587766,"44":0.024059056,"63":0.001939464},"appliedTotal":9.106427602000002,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":3.124015542,"24":13.58082648,"25":0.074574184,"26":0.002844972,"27":2.0,"28":1.0,"35":0.005894689,"36":0.004126283,"37":0.0079905,"38":2.73E-4,"39":4.347233967,"40":13.58082648,"42":35.90986088,"43":0.246597961,"44":0.012029528,"45":0.003904791,"46":0.002551781,"47":7.0,"48":3.0,"49":1.0,"50":1.0,"53":4.26743552,"56":0.038757825,"57":0.001198696,"58":5.704237858,"60":8.414857286,"61":35.90986088,"62":0.0148745,"63":3.23244E-4,"66":0.034763352,"67":0.047487076,"68":0.082250428,"70":0.015991142,"71":0.026592763,"72":0.042583905,"73":0.042583905,"102":0.025014597,"115":21.56328358,"118":2.0,"210":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":8.686350076769232,"appliedStats":{"53":28.35434683,"102":1.945421514,"72":-1.079357814,"24":16.04418212,"25":5.978936958,"26":0.066298926,"42":47.39073564,"43":13.949056511999999,"44":0.248477222,"63":0.02445309},"appliedTotal"

with the team's new run-first approach, that should be a less exciting proposition than what many have drafted him as this summer. It could be a big start, though. The Texans allowed 97 catches, 1,104 yards and 10 touchdowns to the TE position last year and just traded pass rusher Jadeveon Clowney. Cook won't always be a surefire fantasy TE1, but he belongs in that tier for Week 1. ","2":"Cook was targeted just twice in Week 1. This problem probably will be frequent, as Drew Brees often looks toward Ted Ginn Jr. and Tre'Quan Smith for secondary looks beyond Michael Thomas and Alvin Kamara. On a positive note, in his first game with the Saints, he averaged 12.3 yards on his three targets, which preserves his big-play potential. Cook remains on the borderline of fantasy TE1 value for Week 2 as New Orleans will probably have to throw often to keep up with the Rams offense on the road.","3":"Cook caught just 2-of-7 targets in Week 2 and must deal with injured QB Drew Brees (thumb) set to miss 6-to-8 weeks. Teddy Bridgewater and Taysom Hill could lean on the TE position to get by, but Cook isn't necessarily known for that type of intermediate game. His high-risk, high-reward profile could pay off against the Seahawks, though. Seattle has allowed 20.6 TE fantasy points-per-game, third-most in the league. Consider Cook a low-end TE1 for Week 3.","4":"Cook was in on 75.9% of snaps in Week 3 but was targeted just twice. His role could expand in Week 4 as Teddy Bridgewater gets tasked to once again replace Drew Brees (thumb). The Cowboys rank among the 10 friendliest TE matchups, giving up 15.1 fantasy points-per-game to the position so far.

ook signed with the Saints during the offseason after stints with the Titans, Rams, Packers and Raiders. After nine seasons in the league and no top-10 fantasy campaigns to show, Cook finally reached his potential with a breakout 2018 campaign. Cook hit career highs in targets (101), receptions (68), receiving yards (896) and touchdowns (six). He was fantasy's No. 5 scoring tight end. Cook's usage has been incredibly consistent, as he's averaged target shares between 16 and 18 percent each of the past seven seasons. If he keeps that streak alive in the Saints' high-scoring offense this season, Cook will no doubt post his second consecutive top-10 fantasy campaign. The 32-year-old is a solid TE1 target.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":6.301465351500001,"appliedStats":{"53":23.01308966,"72":-0.81213332,"42":56.11935759000001,"43":22.202171904,"44":0.283861482,"63":0.017098308},"appliedTotal":100.82344562400002,"externalId":"2018","id":"102018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"41":46.02617932,"42":561.1935759,"43":3.700361984,"44":0.141930741,"45":0.12133123,"46":0.079289959,"47":112.0,"48":56.0,"49":28.0,"50":22.0,"51":11.0,"52":5.0,"53":46.02617932,"54":9.0,"55":4.0,"56":0.583280028,"57":0.018039588,"58":76.6391165,"60":12.192921163372377,"61":35.07459849,"62":0.141930741,"63":0.002849718,"67":0.725119035,"68":0.725119035,"71":0.40606666,"72":0.40606666,"73":0.40606666,"210":16.0}},{"appliedAverage":8.691184012499999,"appliedStats":{"53":28.59857594,"72":-0.673182456,"42":72.69000625,"43":37.743167172,"44":0.6862044,"63":0.014172894},"appliedTotal":139.05894419999998,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"42":726.9000625,"43":6.290527862,"44":0.3431022,"45":0.214103686,"46":0.139916759,"47":145.0,"48":72.0,"49":36.0,"50":29.0,"51":14.0,"53":57.19715188,"54":11.0,"55":5.0,"56":1.192120312,"57":0.0368697,"58":86.54280463,"60":12.70867584,"61":45.4312539,"62":0.3431022,"63":0.002362149,"67":0.601055764,"68":0.601055764,"71":0.336591228,"72":0.336591228,"73":0.336591228,"210":16.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":1.3070996055,"72":-0.04071879,"42":3.283795447,"43":1.6562292360000002,"44":0.029262818,"63":8.58E-4},"appliedTotal":6.236526316500001,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"42":32.83795447,"43":0.276038206,"44":0.014631409,"45":0.008776648,"46":0.005735539,"47":6.0,"48":3.0,"49":1.0,"50":1.0,"53":2.614199211,"56":0.030351292,"57":9.387E-4,"58":4.326277448,"60":12.56138183,"61":32.83795447,"62":0.014631409,"63":1.43E-4,"67":0.036356062,"68":0.036356062,"71":0.020359395,"72":0.020359395,"73":0.020359395,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":1.5570951435,"72":-0.048598478,"42":3.9633179730000005,"43":1.813919208,"44":0.031259766,"63":0.001026},"appliedTotal":7.3180196125000005,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"42":39.63317973,"43":0.302319868,"44":0.015629883,"45":0.009143854,"46":0.005975509,"47":7.0,"48":3.0,"49":1.0,"50":1.0,"53":3.114190287,"56":0.050910013,"57":0.001574536,"58":5.171103727,"60":12.72664034,"61":39.63317973,"62":0.015629883,"63":1.71E-4,"67":0.043391498,"68":0.043391498,"71":0.024299239,"72":0.024299239,"73":0.024299239,"210":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":6.465655013846154,"appliedStats":{"53":17.32272391,"72":-0.539637792,"42":43.616299,"43":23.239316274,"44":0.403452488,"63":0.0113613},"appliedTotal":84.05351518,"externalId":"2019","id":"122019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{"42":436.16299,"43":3.873219379,"44":0.201726244,"45":0.130690824,"46":0.085406453,"47":87.0,"48":43.0,"49":21.0,"50":17.0,"51":8.0,"53":34.64544782,"54":6.0,"55":3.0,"56":0.420950194,"57":0.013019078,"58":55.74722849,"60":12.58933042,"61":33.55099923,"62":0.201726244,"63":0.00189355,"67":0.481819457,"68":0.481819457,"71":0.269818896,"72":0.269818896,"73":0.269818896,"210":13.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":1.5,"42":2.1},"appliedTotal":3.6,"externalId":"401128102","id":"01401128102","proTeamId":18,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"48":2.0,"49":1.0,"210":1.0,"53":3.0,"41":3.0,"58":6.0,"42":21.0,"59":1.0,"155":1.0,"60":7.0,"61":21.0,"47":4.0}},{"appliedAverage":9.975000000000001,"appliedStats":{"53":34.0,"42":89.60000000000001,"43":36.0},"appliedTotal":159.60000000000002,"externalId":"2018","id":"002018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"41":68.0,"42":896.0,"43":6.0,"47":175.0,"48":86.0,"49":39.0,"50":28.0,"51":11.0,"52":4.0,"53":68.0,"54":5.0,"56":4.0,"58":101.0,"59":45.0,"60":13.176470588235293,"61":56.0,"108":2.0,"109":2.0,"155":4.0,"156":12.0,"174":0.25,"210":16.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":0.5,"42":0.7000000000000001},"appliedTotal":1.2000000000000002,"externalId":"401127993","id":"01401127993","proTeamId":18,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"41":1.0,"42":7.0,"47":1.0,"53":1.0,"58":2.0,"59":1.0,"60":7.0,"61":7.0,"155":1.0,"210":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":3.1333333333333333,"appliedStats":{"53":2.5,"42":6.9},"appliedTotal":9.4,"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"41":5.0,"42":69.0,"108":1.0,"109":1.0,"47":13.0,"48":5.0,"49":2.0,"210":3.0,"50":2.0,"53":5.0,"58":12.0,"59":25.0,"155":2.0,"60":13.8,"156":1.0,"61":23.0}}],"universeId":2},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":31,"total

of noise in his pro debut last year, hauling in 43 catches and scoring three times. Still, the agile, tough Texas A&M product will have rookie Kyler Murray under center and a full season of experience under his belt, making him an interesting player to watch from a fantasy perspective. He's in the flex discussion against a Lions defense that allowed the fifth-most yards-per-catch last season. ","2":"Kirk handled a healthy workload in Week 1, seeing 12 targets and also getting a rushing attempt. However, only four of his targets were caught and they only amounted to 32 yards -- including just three yards after the catch. He's definitely second-in-line for looks in the passing game behind veteran Larry Fitzgerald, and that's unlikely to change even if Michael Crabtree suits up in the near future. Still, Kirk's outlook for Week 2 isn't great. The Ravens allowed the seventh-fewest points to opposing wideouts a season ago and, in Week 1, they limited every Dolphins wideout outside of top target DeVante Parker to fewer than 30 yards receiving. He's one for the bench given the tough matchup.","3":"While veteran Larry Fitzgerald gets the most looks in the Arizona passing game, Kirk is right behind him -- and still ranks among the top 15 in the NFL in terms of opportunity. Kirk hasn't done quite as much with the opportunities he's been given, but that's to be expected when comparing a young wideout to a generational talent like Fitzgerald. A matchup with the Panthers in Week 3 doesn't bode particularly well for Kirk, because even though Carolina did allow Chris Godwin to break out in Week 2, that's the only aerial damage anyone has done against them this season. Kirk is in the WR3/flex discussion.","4":"Kirk is matching Larry Fitzgerald target-for-target so far this season, as the Cardinals' top pair of receivers have seen 62 (31 each) of the team's 137 passing attempts. Kirk is not making any big plays, though, averaging only 10.3 yards-per-reception and failing to find the end zone. Still, his volume is valuable and he has the skills as a runner to turn even short completions into big plays, so the big point totals are certainly still to come.

selected Kirk in the second round of the 2018 draft and immediately slotted him in as a full-time player. Kirk was on the field for 85 percent of the team's pass plays and handled a generous 21 percent target share before landing on injured reserve with a broken foot. Kirk failed to post a single top-10 fantasy week, but was efficient, managing an 8.8 YPT and 5.3 RAC. Larry Fitzgerald is another year older, so the 22-year-old Kirk could very well take over as the team's No. 1 receiver this season, though he'll need to fend off rookies Andy Isabella and and KeeSean Johnson. Arizona's quarterback upgrade to Kyler Murray further helps Kirk's breakout chances. Consider him a borderline flex.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":8.418962177916667,"appliedStats":{"53":23.835765725,"101":0.356724,"72":-0.559011448,"42":59.094022859999995,"43":18.038100432,"44":0.250184566,"63":0.01176},"appliedTotal":101.027546135,"externalId":"2018","id":"102018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"41":47.67153145,"42":590.9402286,"43":3.006350072,"44":0.125092283,"45":0.116437131,"46":0.076091665,"47":118.0,"48":59.0,"49":29.0,"50":23.0,"51":11.0,"52":5.0,"53":47.67153145,"54":9.0,"55":4.0,"56":0.674583372,"57":0.020863403,"58":81.48757161,"60":12.396082328922116,"61":36.93376429,"62":0.125092283,"63":0.00196,"67":0.499117364,"68":0.499117364,"71":0.279505724,"72":0.279505724,"73":0.279505724,"101":0.059454,"114":222.9525,"210":12.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":5.0,"42":5.9},"appliedTotal":10.9,"externalId":"401127962","id":"01401127962","proTeamId":22,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"41":10.0,"42":59.0,"47":11.0,"48":5.0,"49":2.0,"50":2.0,"51":1.0,"53":10.0,"54":2.0,"55":1.0,"58":12.0,"59":42.0,"60":5.9,"61":59.0,"115":20.0,"118":2.0,"156":1.0,"210":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":8.793410366375,"appliedStats":{"53":31.18581527,"102":1.217605656,"72":-0.769857334,"24":2.1818637620000003,"25":0.5698368540000001,"26":0.006260296,"42":83.25257324,"43":22.637242116,"44":0.396841694,"63":0.016384308},"appliedTotal":140.694565862,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":3.993620761,"24":21.81863762,"25":0.094972809,"26":0.003130148,"27":4.0,"28":2.0,"29":1.0,"35":0.007340903,"36":0.005138632,"37":0.001152567,"38":3.93327E-5,"39":5.463372444,"40":1.363664851,"42":832.5257324,"43":3.772873686,"44":0.198420847,"45":0.222601802,"46":0.145470277,"47":166.0,"48":83.0,"49":41.0,"50":33.0,"51":16.0,"53":62.37163054,"54":12.0,"55":6.0,"56":1.720727895,"57":0.053218389,"58":98.06395697,"60":13.34782697,"61":52.03285828,"62":0.201550995,"63":0.002730718,"66":0.04181291,"67":0.6530263,"68":0.69483921,"70":0.019233939,"71":0.365694728,"72":0.384928667,"73":0.384928667,"102":0.202934276,"115":240.1242521,"118":24.0,"119":9.0,"210":16.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":2.679252841,"102":0.078804,"72":-0.051872328,"24":0.1322748453,"25":0.030608172,"26":4.41302E-4,"42":6.388120162,"43":1.8945076920000001,"44":0.028964438,"63":0.001098},"appliedTotal":11.182199124299999,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":0.208140655,"24":1.322748453,"25":0.005101362,"26":2.20651E-4,"35":3.82445E-4,"36":2.67712E-4,"37":6.69716E-5,"38":2.28548E-6,"39":6.355070103,"40":1.322748453,"42":63.88120162,"43":0.315751282,"44":0.014482219,"45":0.009035407,"46":0.005904639,"47":12.0,"48":6.0,"49":3.0,"50":2.0,"51":1.0,"53":5.358505682,"54":1.0,"56":0.18152416,"57":0.005614149,"58":8.358460239,"60":11.92145822,"61":63.88120162,"62":0.014702871,"63":1.83E-4,"66":0.001743374,"67":0.044882523,"68":0.046625896,"70":8.01952E-4,"71":0.025134213,"72":0.025936164,"73":0.025936164,"102":0.013134,"115":14.88814815,"118":1.0,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":2.2913559995,"102":0.078804,"72":-0.044875424,"24":0.1554372555,"25":0.037692072,"26":4.74812E-4,"42":6.025599580000001,"43":1.8798568679999998,"44":0.030280734,"63":9.534119999999999E-4},"appliedTotal":10.455579309,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":0.244587791,"24":1.554372555,"25":0.006282012,"26":2.37406E-4,"35":4.49566E-4,"36":3.14696E-4,"37":9.44926E-5,"38":3.22E-6,"39":6.355070103,"40":1.554372555,"42":60.2559958,"43":0.313309478,"44":0.015140367,"45":0.011873534,"46":0.007759355,"47":12.0,"48":6.0,"49":3.0,"50":2.0,"51":1.0,"53":4.582711999,"56":0.156999493,"57":0.004855654,"58":7.380792548,"60":13.14854519,"61":60.2559958,"62":0.015377774,"63":1.58902E-4,"66":0.002048653,"67":0.038384521,"68":0.040433174,"70":9.4238E-4,"71":0.021495332,"72":0.022437712,"73":0.022437712,"102":0.013134,"115":14.4872,"118":1.0,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":2.0,"24":0.6000000000000001,"42":3.7},"appliedTotal":6.300000000000001,"externalId":"401128064","id":"01401128064","proTeamId":22,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"39":6.0,"40":6.0,"41":4.0,"42":37.0,"47":7.0,"48":3.0,"49":1.0,"210":1.0,"50":1.0,"115":1.0,"53":4.0,"23":1.0,"24":6.0,"58":5.0,"59":4.0,"27":1.0,"60":9.25,"156":1.0,"61":37.0}},{"appliedAverage":11.315852611923075,"appliedStats":{"53":35.960353485,"102":1.02863475,"72":-0.694768638,"24":1.6600281580000003,"25":0.338179764,"26":0.005100446,"42":86.3927382,"43":22.065721019999998,"44":0.335377522,"63":0.014719248},"appliedTotal":147.10608395499997,"externalId":"2019","id":"122019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{"23":2.60537683

the Buccaneers' lead back. By many assessments, that's where the excitement ends. Ronald Jones and preseason star Dare Ogunbowale may overshadow him in hype circles, but Barber looks like the best bet for early-down and goal-line work. Against the visiting 49ers, that's enough to assign Barber high-end fantasy flex value. Fantasy managers shouldn't count on this stability for the entire season, though.","2":"Barber took a back seat to Ronald Jones with just 45 scrimmage yards in Week 1. Jameis Winston's struggles under center could limit this offense for the near future, though regardless, Jones looked like the better back. Barber is a mere flex fantasy starter against the Panthers, though Carolina did allow 150 yards and two scores to the Rams' ground game. The Rams are a much better backfield, but perhaps there are lingering holes in the Panthers defense.","3":"In a sluggish Thursday night win, the Buccaneers rode Barber with Jameis Winston struggling again under center. This plot could repeat itself in Week 3 against the lowly Giants defense, which is tied with several teams in allowing a league-high three RB ground scores. Count Barber as a high-end fantasy flex.","4":"Barber had 15 touches in Week 3 but took a backseat to Ronald Jones in a high-scoring clash with the Giants. Barber hasn't averaged better than 4.1 YPC in any game this year. He'll continue to split time with Ronald Jones in a pass-first offense. Expect the Buccaneers to need to throw often against the Rams in Week 4, which lowers Barber's ceiling to that of only a decent fantasy flex play."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":0.8003095975232198,"averageDraftPosition":144.28436927178802,"percentChange":-4.513244696872846,"percentOwned":72.54649973941349,"percentStarted":15.843374694914434},"proTeamId":27,"rankings":{"0":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":43,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":36,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":33,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":33,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":33,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":32,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":34,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":35,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":34,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":42,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":34.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":34.666666666666664,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":35,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"2":[],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":26,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":24,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":26,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":26,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":30,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":30,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":21,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":23,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":26,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":24.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":26.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":26,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":32,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":31,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":32,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":30,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":31,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":34,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":30,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":33,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":34,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":31.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":32.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":74,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":32,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}]},"seasonOutlook":"An undrafted free-agent signing back in 2016, Barber plodded his way to a pair of nondescript first two NFL seasons. He was forced into a much larger role in 2018, however, with second-round pick Ronald Jones struggling badly immediately upon joining the team. Barber went on to rack up 234 carries (ninth-most), but failed to impress, averaging a career-low 3.7 YPC (1.9 YAC). Despite ranking 10th at the position in snaps (583), Barber was targeted only 28 times. He turned those looks into 20 catches for 92 yards (3.3 YPT). Barber finished five weeks better than 37th at the position in fantasy points. The Buccaneers will be hoping for a much better season from Jones, but even if Barber remains the starter, he's a replacement-level back who is only worth a mid-to-late pick.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":8.0634393809375,"appliedStats":{"53":11.716437435,"72":-2.116446394,"24":71.82139216,"25":24.227739101999997,"26":0.562,"42":18.22595968,"43":4.440673992000001,"44":0.08435412,"63":0.052919999999999995},"appliedTotal":129.015030095,"externalId":"2018","id":"102018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":176.9075175,"24":718.2139216,"25":4.037956517,"26":0.281,"27":143.0,"28":71.0,"29":35.0,"30":28.0,"31":14.0,"32":7.0,"33":35.0,"34":17.0,"35":0.358,"36":0.251,"37":1.44,"38":0.049,"39":4.059827031375306,"40":47.68225206,"41":23.43287487,"42":182.2595968,"43":0.740112332,"44":0.04217706,"45":0.05667026,"46":0.037034015,"47":36.0,"48":18.0,"49":9.0,"50":7.0,"51":3.0,"52":1.0,"53":23.43287487,"54":4.0,"55":2.0,"56":0.068235242,"57":0.002110368,"58":29.81512178,"60":7.777944354294245,"61":12.1002222,"62":0.323301905,"63":0.00882,"66":1.98,"67":0.262404724,"68":2.243440707,"70":0.911,"71":0.146946645,"72":1.058223197,"73":1.058223197,"210":16.0}},{"appliedAverage":8.6449904682,"appliedStats":{"53":15.642725745,"72":-1.415372788,"24":64.61158281,"25":21.671479836,"26":0.348724636,"42":22.367974720000003,"43":6.320122272000001,"44":0.092554568,"63":0.035065224000000006},"appliedTotal":129.674857023,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":165.582539,"24":646.1158281,"25":3.611913306,"26":0.174362318,"27":129.0,"28":64.0,"29":32.0,"30":25.0,"31":12.0,"33":33.0,"34":16.0,"35":0.332838159,"36":0.232986711,"37":1.148492483,"38":0.039193642,"39":3.902077067,"40":42.89565664,"42":223.6797472,"43":1.053353712,"44":0.046277284,"45":0.040463116,"46":0.026442646,"47":44.0,"48":22.0,"49":11.0,"50":8.0,"51":4.0,"53":31.28545149,"54":6.0,"55":3.0,"56":0.084767537,"57":0.002621676,"58":39.98513383,"60":7.149641016,"61":14.85010769,"62":0.220639603,"63":0.005844204,"66":1.250754996,"67":0.236319814,"68":1.487074809,"70":0.575347298,"71":0.132339096,"72":0.707686394,"73":0.707686394,"210":15.0625}},{"appliedStats":{"53":1.0,"24":4.800000000000001,"42":0.7000000000000001},"appliedTotal":6.500000000000001,"externalId":"401127966","id":"01401127966","proTeamId":27,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":13.0,"24":48.0,"27":9.0,"28":4.0,"29":2.0,"30":1.0,"33":2.0,"34":1.0,"39":3.692,"40":48.0,"41":2.0,"42":7.0,"47":1.0,"53":2.0,"58":2.0,"59":10.0,"60":3.5,"61":7.0,"156":1.0,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":1.1233777175,"72":-0.112923174,"24":4.631848903000001,"25":1.086061344,"26":0.0208,"42":1.604761871,"43":0.364742226,"44":0.005113118,"63":0.002796},"appliedTotal":8.726578005500002,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":11.80070865,"24":46.31848903,"25":0.181010224,"26":0.0104,"27":9.0,"28":4.0,"29":2.0,"30":1.0,"33":2.0,"34":1.0,"35":0.024,"36":0.0168,"37":0.0938,"38":0.0032,"39":3.92505996,"40":46.31848903,"42":16.04761871,"43":0.060790371,"44":0.002556559,"45":0.002452958,"46":0.001603008,"47":3.0,"48":1.0,"53":2.246755435,"56":0.006355798,"57":1.96571E-4,"58":2.883995894,"60":7.142574785,"61":16.04761871,"62":0.012952542,"63":4.66E-4,"66":0.0996,"67":0.01897184,"68":0.118618268,"70":0.0458,"71":0.01062423,"72":0.056461587,"73":0.056461587,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":1.001850585,"72":-0.128475444,"24":5.492739542000001,"25":2.1487943520000004,"26":0.028657488,"42":1.4946437970000002,"43":0.444916266,"44":0.006920932,"63":0.003205548},"appliedTotal":10.493253066000001,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":13.98431701,"24":54.92739542,"25":0.358132392,"26":0.014328744,"27":10.0,"28":5.0,"29":2.0,"30":2.0,"31":1.0,"33":2.0,"34":1.0,"35":0.028963037,"36":0.020274126,"37":0.131943935,"38":0.00450274,"39":3.927785344,"40":54.92739542,"42":14.94643797,"43":0.074152711,"44":0.003460466,"45":0.002792492,"46":0.001824893,"47":2.0,"48":1.0,"53":2.00370117,"56":0.0057551,"57":1.77993E-4,"58":2.583661769,"60":7.459414705,"61":14.94643797,"62":0.01778921,"63":5.34258E-4,"66":0.118906352,"67":0.017037142,"68":0.135943494,"70":0.054696922,"71":0.0095408,"72":0.064237722,"73":0.064237722,"210":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":9.211949723769232,"appliedStats":{"53":14.062801765,"72":-1.564048742,"24":65.58393687,"25":15.89265726,"26":0.291418242,"42":20.368059880000004,"43":5.010963372,"44":0.070687938,"63":0.038869824},"appliedTotal":119.75534640900001,"externalId":"2019","id":"122019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{"23":167.0902802,"24":655.8393687,"25":2.64877621,"26":0.145709121,"27":131.0,"28":65.0,"29":32.0,"30":26.0,"31":13.0,"33":33.0,"34":16.0,"35":0.342974552,"36":0.240082186,"37":1.451310371,"38":0.049527655,"39":3.92505996,"40":50.44918221,"42":20

yards-per-catch as a rookie and displayed the occasional polish that predicts a big step forward in his second season. Amari Cooper (foot/heel) looks like he's on track to play in Week 1, so his presence should limit Gallup to no more than a flex play, given Dallas' run-first approach. Still, if Cooper is limited or a surprise inactive, Gallup could thrive against the Giants -- especially if RB Ezekiel Elliott continues his holdout. Either way, Gallup could spring a big play against New York's questionable secondary, giving every reason to get him somehwere into your lineup.","2":"Complementary receiver? That looks like an unfair label after Gallup's 7-catch, 158-yard Week 1 and how effective Kellen Moore's new offense looked. Washington CB Josh Norman may not shadow Amari Cooper, but even if he focuses on Gallup, the latter still deserves trust as at least a flex play in fantasy lineups, with the upside of a WR2 against the Redskins.","3":"Gallup is set to miss 2-to-4 weeks in order to have knee surgery. He enjoyed another great game in this revamped Dallas offense during Week 2, and he's worth stashing if possible throughout his absence. In the meantime, Randall Cobb and Devin Smith, who both scored on Sunday, are the best in-house replacements for fantasy managers, though both of their workloads will probably remain erratic.","4":"Gallup (knee) sat out in Week 3, marking the first game he's expected to miss due to knee surgery. He's set to be inactive for Week 4, as well, though he's worth rostering in most leagues until he can return.

Gallup -- a third-round pick last season -- played a situational role early on in 2018, but took over as a full-timer just prior to the acquisition of Cooper. Gallup played 77 percent of Dallas' snaps from Week 6 forward and, though he was a minimal fantasy contributor, he certainly showed flashes. Gallup's 14.1 aDOT (13th highest), 5.1 RAC (22nd), 15.4 YPR (12th) all ranked near the top of the league, though he dealt with 31 percent of balls thrown his way registering as off target (sixth-highest). The 23-year-old is an intriguing prospect who figures to be no lower than third in line for targets in a good offense.

It's rare to find a player break out as an offensive threat at 29, but McDonald might just be the outlier. Per this week's matchup, the Patriots allowed more than 800 yards and eight scores to tight ends last season, both above league average.","2":"For all the talk of Vance McDonald's quiet opener, he was fourth on the team with 30 routes and earned four targets with respectable air yardage (near eight yards per target). The Seahawks coughed up a good deal of yardage to the Bengals' tandem of tight ends, so there is at least some matchup appeal for McDonald heading in.","3":"The shift to Mason Rudolph at quarterback didn't stunt McDonald's fantasy profile; if anything their rapport was encouraging for the weeks ahead. The 49ers allowed Tyler Eifert to score this past week, but have been generally solid against tight ends dating back to last season. It's worth trusting McDonald in a starting spot given what should be a healthy share of the offense for this trip to San Francisco.","4":"McDonald's usage is likely to prove volatile a bit this season now that the total passing market is smaller sans Ben Roethlisberger, but he's still in the starting mix at the position given his big-play ability in a matchup with a Bengals defense allowing the third-most yards per catch to tight

after being on the trade block for much of training camp with Miami, Stills is a gifted vertical threat who should fit well into Houston's big-play offense. It's unclear what Stills' role will be after being acquired just days before the season, making it more reasonable to stash the ex-Saints standout in his return to New Orleans.","2":"In his Texans debut, Stills' clutch touchdown catch in the final minute of Week 1 vs. the Saints helped give Houston a brief lead. But Stills only ran 19 routes (out of 35) and could face increased competition for snaps and routes with Keke Coutee on the mend. It's nice to get shares of a top passing attack, but it's best to avoid Stills against the Jaguars' tough secondary.","3":"Competing with the likes of Keke Coutee and Will Fuller for opportunities in the Houston passing game, Stills just doesn't have enough of Deshaun Watson's attention to merit trust in fantasy leagues for this meeting with a solid Chargers secondary.","4":"Stills led the Texans in air yardage and actual yardage in Week 3 and is now clearly ahead of Keke Coutee in the pecking order. Even with great vertical usage, Stills is a risky flex option because he's third in line for total targets and faces a solid secondary in Week 4."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":0.032507739938080496,"averageDraftPosition":169.63228923692103,"percentChange":-0.5796981983845413,"percentOwned":21.519748918106462,"percentStarted":2.0295738927234384},"proTeamId":34,"rankings":{"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":43,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":48,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":41,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":45.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4}]},"seasonOutlook":"Stills has been around since 2013, but has yet to finish a season better than 28th at the position in fantasy points. That's despite missing only two games in six seasons and despite having scored at least six touchdowns each of the past three seasons. Volume is the chief concern for Stills, as he's ranked higher than 56th at the position in targets once in his career (2017). Stills is a terrific deep threat (he's ranked top 13 in aDOT and Top 22 in YPR each of the past four seasons), but his role as a situational deep threat limits his fantasy upside.

Richard was limited to a career-low 55 carries, but his 80 targets more than doubled his previous career high. He caught 85 percent of his targets (fourth-best) and finished top-eight at the position in yards per target (7.6) for the second season in a row. Although Oakland called pass on 81 percent of Richard's snaps, he averaged more than 4.7 YPC for the third consecutive season. Richard scored only one touchdown, his best weekly fantasy finish was 16th, and he's a candidate for a dip in targets after Oakland revamped at wide receiver. His role as a complement to Josh Jacobs is enough for flex value in deep PPR leagues.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":2.7216015544375,"appliedStats":{"53":8.920558225,"101":0.23781599999999997,"102":0.2532024,"72":-0.585635472,"24":13.070719,"25":4.005167208,"26":0.04202395,"42":14.367902659999999,"43":3.179358528,"44":0.040652372,"63":0.01386},"appliedTotal":43.545624871,"externalId":"2018","id":"102018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":29.080253,"24":130.70719,"25":0.667527868,"26":0.021011975,"27":26.0,"28":13.0,"29":6.0,"30":5.0,"31":2.0,"32":1.0,"33":5.0,"34":2.0,"35":0.054228042,"36":0.037959629,"37":0.045996611,"38":0.001569688,"39":4.494706081133476,"40":8.67765577,"41":17.84111645,"42":143.6790266,"43":0.529893088,"44":0.020326186,"45":0.056384422,"46":0.03684722,"47":28.0,"48":14.0,"49":7.0,"50":5.0,"51":2.0,"52":1.0,"53":17.84111645,"54":3.0,"55":1.0,"56":0.055699397,"57":0.00172,"58":23.4643058,"60":8.053253113540435,"61":9.538856536,"62":0.041338161,"63":0.00231,"66":0.364397259,"67":0.223562495,"68":0.587959754,"70":0.167622739,"71":0.125194997,"72":0.292817736,"73":0.292817736,"101":0.039636,"102":0.0422004,"114":259.3466667,"115":52.03732308,"210":16.0}},{"appliedAverage":7.409515183266667,"appliedStats":{"53":29.914169935,"102":0.1266012,"72":-1.233853776,"24":19.179026490000002,"25":6.1011355080000005,"26":0.08312608,"42":49.089077970000005,"43":7.732327440000001,"44":0.123074372,"63":0.02804253},"appliedTotal":111.142727749,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":42.00265418,"24":191.7902649,"25":1.016855918,"26":0.04156304,"27":38.0,"28":19.0,"29":9.0,"30":7.0,"31":3.0,"33":8.0,"34":4.0,"35":0.078905119,"36":0.055233584,"37":0.100137446,"38":0.003417307,"39":4.566146322,"40":12.73296364,"42":490.8907797,"43":1.28872124,"44":0.061537186,"45":0.08756113,"46":0.057221198,"47":98.0,"48":49.0,"49":24.0,"50":19.0,"51":9.0,"53":59.82833987,"54":11.0,"55":5.0,"56":0.407332939,"57":0.012597926,"58":72.29112249,"60":8.204987481,"61":32.59025923,"62":0.103100226,"63":0.004673755,"66":0.4905352,"67":0.698715528,"68":1.189250728,"70":0.225646192,"71":0.391280696,"72":0.616926888,"73":0.616926888,"102":0.0211002,"115":25.38513433,"118":2.0,"119":1.0,"210":15.0625}},{"appliedStats":{"53":1.5,"24":1.5,"42":1.4000000000000001},"appliedTotal":4.4,"externalId":"401127956","id":"01401127956","proTeamId":13,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":2.0,"24":15.0,"27":3.0,"28":1.0,"39":7.5,"40":15.0,"41":3.0,"42":14.0,"47":2.0,"48":1.0,"53":3.0,"58":3.0,"59":9.0,"60":4.667,"61":14.0,"68":1.0,"156":1.0,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":1.265800777,"102":0.078804,"72":-0.052213254,"24":0.9442620793000001,"25":0.18958400999999997,"26":0.00240803,"42":1.9984436570000002,"43":0.24939419999999998,"44":0.004236544,"63":0.001194192},"appliedTotal":4.6819142353,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":2.030723201,"24":9.442620793,"25":0.031597335,"26":0.001204015,"27":1.0,"35":0.003794103,"36":0.002655872,"37":0.003841561,"38":1.31098E-4,"39":4.649880786,"40":9.442620793,"42":19.98443657,"43":0.0415657,"44":0.002118272,"45":0.004358351,"46":0.002848183,"47":3.0,"48":1.0,"53":2.531601554,"56":0.009236024,"57":2.8565E-4,"58":3.094038688,"60":7.893989691,"61":19.98443657,"62":0.003322287,"63":1.99032E-4,"66":0.022542166,"67":0.028102197,"68":0.050644363,"70":0.010369396,"71":0.01573723,"72":0.026106627,"73":0.026106627,"102":0.013134,"115":15.09557143,"118":1.0,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":1.0359435745,"101":0.03708,"102":0.078804,"72":-0.045599082,"24":0.8900128836000001,"25":0.20008162200000001,"26":0.002244028,"42":1.5908685,"43":0.16245284399999999,"44":0.00302422,"63":0.001050102},"appliedTotal":3.9559626921000004,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":1.915272003,"24":8.900128836,"25":0.033346937,"26":0.001122014,"27":1.0,"35":0.003574649,"36":0.002502254,"37":0.003409053,"38":1.16E-4,"39":4.646926819,"40":8.900128836,"42":15.908685,"43":0.027075474,"44":0.00151211,"45":0.00379445,"46":0.002479673,"47":3.0,"48":1.0,"53":2.071887149,"56":0.006275705,"57":1.94094E-4,"58":2.544296542,"60":7.678354975,"61":15.908685,"62":0.002634124,"63":1.75017E-4,"66":0.021392108,"67":0.023141378,"68":0.044533485,"70":0.009840369,"71":0.012959172,"72":0.022799541,"73":0.022799541,"101":0.00618,"102":0.013134,"114":40.43703704,"115":15.53955882,"116":4.0,"117":1.0,"118":1.0,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":0.5,"24":1.7000000000000002,"42":0.1},"appliedTotal":2.3000000000000003,"externalId":"401128030","id":"01401128030","proTeamId":13,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"39":4.25,"40":17.0,"41":1.0,"42":1.0,"210":1.0,"53":1.0,"23":4.0,"24":17.0,"58":1.0,"59":1.0,"27":3

league). Things shouldn't be much different this time around, but a matchup with the Falcons isn't the best from a defense and special teams perspective. Atlanta tied for seventh in fewest turnovers by an offense last season and also ranked in the middle of the league in sacks allowed. Still, there aren't 10-12 better options, so lock Minnesota in as a starting D/ST.","2":"The Vikings D/ST looked solid in Week 1, especially from a fantasy perspective. They picked off a pair of passes, recovered a fumble, racked up four sacks and blocked a punt. Those actions, more than points or yards allowed, always fuel fantasy success, which is why the Vikings are a must-start even against the Packers in Week 2. ","3":"If you could have any Vikings fantasy option, you'd pick Dalvin Cook. After Cook, the D/ST might be the most valuable fantasy asset the team has to offer. With five turnovers forced and six sacks so far, they're off to a strong start -- and figure to only get better as the season goes on. This week's matchup with the Raiders is decent because, while they did throw two interceptions and allow three sacks against the Chiefs in Week 2, they allowed no sacks and did not give the ball away in Week 1 against an elite Broncos defense. Still, if you have the Vikings D/ST, you're starting them. Just don't expect the best score, given the Raiders' track record so far this season.","4":"They've yet to score a touchdown, but the Vikings D/ST has three interceptions, three recovered fumbles and 10 sacks through three games. That's the sort of consistent performance you can expect from one of fantasy's premier D/ST units. Keep Minnesota in your lineup in a favorable matchup with a Bears team that struggled against the other top defenses (Green Bay and Denver) they faced earlier this season."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":1.1601866251944013,"averageDraftPosition":117.09656670286526,"percentChange":1.641784688624469,"percentOwned":90.4255556828804,"percentStarted":76.80600089223489},"proTeamId":16,"rankings":{"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":21,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":17,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":22,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":16.166666666666668,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":15.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":21,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16}],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":10.666666666666666,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":12.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":5.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":6.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":3.8333333333333335,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":3.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":16}]},"seasonOutlook":"The

It's possible that dynamic changes in 2019, but an offensive line still full of holes makes a big leap unlikely. That should make the 25-year-old a viable weekly fantasy starter.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":7.059399177937499,"appliedStats":{"80":43.05704295,"85":-5.103830870000003,"86":34.65767713,"74":13.352610625,"77":26.986887012},"appliedTotal":112.95038684699999,"externalId":"2018","id":"102018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"74":2.670522125,"75":4.371436149,"76":1.7009140239999998,"77":6.746721753,"78":8.763083695,"79":2.0163619420000005,"80":14.35234765,"81":15.73890254,"82":1.3865548899999993,"83":23.76959152,"84":28.87342239,"85":5.103830870000003,"86":34.65767713,"87":37.79864245,"88":3.1409653199999994,"210":16.0}},{"appliedAverage":8.677135155999999,"appliedStats":{"80":54.53136977999999,"85":-5.127493329,"86":37.71837342,"74":17.429031705,"77":34.28288092},"appliedTotal":138.83416249599998,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"74":3.485806341,"75":5.406718789,"76":1.920912447,"77":8.57072023,"78":10.78868478,"79":2.217964547,"80":18.17712326,"81":19.16573959,"82":0.988616335,"83":30.23364983,"84":35.36114316,"85":5.127493329,"86":37.71837342,"87":39.68193382,"88":1.963560404,"198":3.485806341,"199":5.406718789,"200":1.920912447,"210":16.0}},{"appliedStats":{"80":3.1799167230000003,"85":-0.359843547,"86":2.638869002,"74":1.00342925,"77":1.988698192},"appliedTotal":8.45106962,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"74":0.20068585,"75":0.323792689,"76":0.123106839,"77":0.497174548,"78":0.646103005,"79":0.148928456,"80":1.059972241,"81":1.147780493,"82":0.087808252,"83":1.75783264,"84":2.117676187,"85":0.359843547,"86":2.638869002,"87":2.850990237,"88":0.212121235,"198":0.20068585,"199":0.323792689,"200":0.123106839}},{"appliedStats":{"80":3.043578255,"85":-0.286182564,"86":2.015546601,"74":0.97277259,"77":1.913442324},"appliedTotal":7.659157206,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"74":0.194554518,"75":0.301767071,"76":0.107212553,"77":0.478360581,"78":0.602152606,"79":0.123792025,"80":1.014526085,"81":1.069704072,"82":0.055177986,"83":1.687441185,"84":1.973623748,"85":0.286182564,"86":2.015546601,"87":2.120472852,"88":0.104926251,"198":0.194554518,"199":0.301767071,"200":0.107212553}},{"appliedAverage":7.7143055654615384,"appliedStats":{"80":37.93490145,"85":-4.292763198,"86":30.9491699,"74":11.970436015,"77":23.724228184},"appliedTotal":100.285972351,"externalId":"2019","id":"122019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{"74":2.394087203,"75":3.862693525,"76":1.468606323,"77":5.931057046,"78":7.707703038,"79":1.776645992,"80":12.64496715,"81":13.69247803,"82":1.047510884,"83":20.97011139,"84":25.26287459,"85":4.292763198,"86":30.9491699,"87":33.43696908,"88":2.487799179,"198":2.394087203,"199":3.862693525,"200":1.468606323,"210":13.0}},{"appliedStats":{"85":-1.0,"86":3.0},"appliedTotal":2.0,"externalId":"401127970","id":"01401127970","proTeamId":34,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"75":1.0,"76":1.0,"84":1.0,"85":1.0,"86":3.0,"87":4.0,"88":1.0,"155":1.0,"158":3.0,"199":1.0,"200":1.0,"210":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":10.3125,"appliedStats":{"80":63.0,"85":-5.0,"86":39.0,"74":20.0,"77":48.0},"appliedTotal":165.0,"externalId":"2018","id":"002018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"74":4.0,"75":6.0,"76":2.0,"77":12.0,"78":15.0,"79":3.0,"80":21.0,"81":21.0,"83":37.0,"84":42.0,"85":5.0,"86":39.0,"87":41.0,"88":2.0,"108":1.0,"109":1.0,"155":11.0,"156":5.0,"174":0.6875,"210":16.0}},{"appliedStats":{"80":3.0,"85":-1.0,"86":1.0},"appliedTotal":3.0,"externalId":"401128026","id":"01401128026","proTeamId":34,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"199":1.0,"200":1.0,"75":1.0,"76":1.0,"80":1.0,"81":1.0,"83":1.0,"84":2.0,"85":1.0,"86":1.0,"87":1.0,"156":1.0,"158":4.0}},{"appliedAverage":4.333333333333333,"appliedStats":{"80":6.0,"85":-1.0,"86":8.0},"appliedTotal":13.0,"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"199":1.0,"200":1.0,"75":1.0,"76":1.0,"80":2.0,"81":2.0,"210":3.0,"83":2.0,"84":3.0,"85":1.0,"86":8.0,"87":9.0,"88":1.0,"155":2.0,"156":1.0,"158":14.0}}],"universeId":1},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":26,"totalRanking":238,"totalRating":13.0}},"rosterLocked":true,"status":"ONTEAM","tradeLocked":false},"status":"NORMAL"},{"acquisitionDate":1566789842875,"acquisitionType":"DRAFT","injuryStatus":"NORMAL","lineupSlotId":0,"pendingTransactionIds":null,"playerId":5529,"playerPoolEntry":{"appliedStatTotal":38.9,"id":5529,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":16,"lineupLocked":true,"onTeamId":8,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":1,"draftR

defense at home this week, placing him on the QB1 fringe in a contest with a modest projected point total. Helping Rivers' case as a starting option this Sunday is the deep and dynamic collection of skill players at his disposal, even sans Melvin Gordon.","2":"Rivers now has four career openers with at least 300 passing yards in his career, while all other Chargers QBs have combined for four such games in franchise history. The Lions were strong against the Cardinals' air raid offense for much of Week 1, only to still cough up a 300-yard showing to Kyler Murray in an eventual tie. Rivers should be able to push the ball downfield in Detroit on Sunday, setting up another solid QB1 showing.","3":"Found at No. 15 among quarterbacks in fantasy production, Rivers fittingly profiles as a fringe QB1 this week against a strong Houston pass rush. The Texans' secondary is exploitable as long as Rivers gets enough time to operate, which should prove more viable at home with better ability to manage adjustments at the line.","4":"Having just made his 211th consecutive regular-season start, Rivers ironically moved ahead of Eli Manning for the second-longest such streak by a QB in NFL history (Brett Favre, 297). You can enjoy consecutive start 212 in fantasy lineups thanks this meeting with an inept Miami defense allowing more than 10 yards per attempt to opposing arms."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":0.23374613003095976,"averageDraftPosition":156.7022926219258,"percentChange":9.925628735495067,"percentOwned":80.98103523252351,"percentStarted":52.029970602075494},"proTeamId":24,"rankings":{"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":17,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":16.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":17.166666666666668,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":17,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":17,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":15.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":15.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":13.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":13.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":5.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":6.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}]},"seasonOutlook":"Rivers enjoyed one of the best seasons of his career in 2018, throwing 32 touchdowns, which matched his second-highest total of the past decade. Rivers also cleared 4,200 passing yards for the sixth consecutive season and finished top five in yards per completion for the third consecutive season. Despite yet another terrific passing season, Rivers was limited to six top-10 fantasy weeks and failed to finish as a top-10 fantasy QB for the fourth time in five seasons. The culprit? Minimal rushing contributions. Rivers hasn't scored a rushing touchdown since 2011 and has a total of 5 rushing yards on 36 carries over the past two seasons. Unless your league awards more points for passing categories, Rivers is limited to QB2 territory.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":16.920986981874997,"appliedStats":{"19":1.562934928,"4":118.8226436,"20":-23.10000256,"8":173.0,"72":-7.27418019,"24":4.94108587,"25":2.576864766,"26":0.027490862,"63":0.178954434},"appliedTotal":270.73579170999994,"externalId":"2018","id":"102018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":577.0296687,"1":361.9436006,"2":215.08606809999998,"3":4338.88126,"4":29.7056609,"5":867.0,"6":433.0,"7":216.0,"8":173.0,"9":86.0,"10":43.0,"11":72.0,"12":36.0,"13":43.0,"14":21.0,"15":3.920619597,"16":2.562124907,"17":4.927463443,"18":0.665571112,"19":0.781467464,"20":11.55000128,"21":0.627253017,"22":272.457222,"23":23.73042127,"24":49.4108587,"25":0.429477461,"26":0.013745431,"27":9.0,"28":4.0,"29":2.0,"30":1.0,"33":4.0,"34":2.0,"35":0.044116648,"36":0.030881653,"37":0.006383347,"38":2.17839E-4,"39":2.082173684900622,"40":3.102722681,"62":0.795212896,"63":0.029825739,"64":25.85637068,"65":7.301836174,"66":0.287410285,"68":7.58924646,"69":3.504881364,"70":0.132208731,"72":3.637090095,"73":15.18709138,"210":16.0}},{"appliedAverage":17.830140774733326,"appliedStats":{"19":2.748362782,"4":120.589597,"20":-24.17122414,"8":169.0,"72":-5.641186586,"24":3.321721891,"25":1.445261634,"26":0.020827738,"63":0.138751302},"appliedTotal":267.4521116209999,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":536.5811881,"1":352.9979581,"2":183.58323,"3":4228.806853,"4":30.14739925,"5":845.0,"6":422.0,"7":211.0,"8":169.0,"9":84.0,"10":42.0,"11":70.0,"12":35.0,"15":3.740058442,"16":2.444128192,"17":4.479864034,"18":0.605112168,"19":1.374181391,"20":12.08561207,"21":0.657864953,"22":269.350755,"23":19.25354862,"24":33.21721891,"25":0.240876939,"26":0.010413869,"27":6.0,"28":3.0,"29":1.0,"30":1.0,"33":3.0,"34":1.0,"35":0.035702354,"36":0.024991648,"37":0.002830155,"38":9.65823E-5,"39":1.725251774,"40":2.115746428,"62":1.38459526,"63":0.023125217,"64":31.0717016,"65":5.691244527,"66":0.193034608,"68":5.884279135,"69":2.731797373,"70":0.08879592,"72":2.820593293,"73":14.90620536,"210":15.7}},{"appliedStats":{"19":0.209629078,"4":9.421666448,"20":-1.530028976,"8":11.0,"72":-0.431291336,"24":0.2940784843,"25":0.131431884,"26":0.00193191,"63":0.01061229},"appliedTotal":19.108029782300004,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"0":33.55744614,"1":21.89231001,"2":11.66513614,"3":277.3404491,"4":2.355416612,"5":55.0,"6":27.0,"7":13.0,"8":11.0,"9":5.0,"10":2.0,"11":4.0,"12":2.0,"15":0.255264316,"16":0.16681523,"17":0.334043077,"18":0.045120461,"19":0.104814539,"20":0.765014488,"21":0.652383078,"22":277.3404491,"23":1.539307831,"24":2.940784843,"25":0.021905314,"26":9.65955E-4,"35":0.002863136,"36":0.002004195,"37":3.5763E-4,"38":1.22E-5,"39":1.910459223,"40":2.940784843,"62":0.105780493,"63":0.001768715,"64":1.304667398,"65":0.431023309,"66":0.019031478,"68":0.450054788,"69":0.206891189,"70":0.00875448,"72":0.215645668,"73":0.980660157,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"19":0.16976946,"4":7.315158212,"20":-1.493877794,"8":10.0,"72":-0.424127832,"24":0.2239268566,"25":0.110639604,"26":0.001539268,"63":0.010432733999999999},"appliedTotal":15.913460508600002,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"0":34.7099618,"1":22.14642864,"2":12.56353315,"3":272.4757224,"4":1.828789553,"5":54.0,"6":27.0,"7":13.0,"8":10.0,"9":5.0,"10":2.0,"11":4.0,"12":2.0,"15":0.246969151,"16":0.16139434,"17":0.31150017,"18":0.042075505,"19":0.08488473,"20":0.746938897,"21":0.638042438,"22":272.4757224,"23":1.298829302,"24":2.239268566,"25":0.018439934,"26":7.69634E-4,"35":0.002410544,"36":0.001687381,"37":2.03407E-4,"38":6.94E-6,"39":1.724066868,"40":2.239268566,"62":0.085654365,"63":0.001738789,"64":1.402187117,"65":0.427079281,"66":0.015360567,"68":0.442439848,"69":0.204998055,"70":0.007065861,"72":0.212063916,"73":0.959002813,"210":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":18.171148389166664,"appliedStats":{"19":2.100464532,"4":91.74547672,"20":-19.864645932,"8":145.0,"72":-6.026517232,"24":3.51641093,"25":1.413804942,"26":0.020526446,"63":0.148260264},"appliedTotal":218.05378066999998,"externalId":"2019","id":"122019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{"0":460.8233203,"1":298.2989664,"2":162.5243539,"3":3630.927948,"4":22.93636918,"5":726.0,"6":363.0,"7":181.0,"8":145.0,"9":72.0,"10":36.0,"11":59.0,"12":29.0,"15":3.367442065,"16":2.20062339,"17":4.512500953,"18":0.60952056,"19":1.050232266,"20":9.932322966,"21":0.647317428,"22":280.5972139,"23":19.25800994,"24":35.1641093,"25":0.235634157,"26":0.010263223,"27":7.0,"28":3.0,"29":1.0,"30":1.0,"33":3.0,"34":1.0,"35":0.035801422,"36":0.025060996,"37":0.003917872,"38":1.33702E-4,"39":1.825947199,"40":2.717473671,"62":1.060495489,"63":

Adams","id":16800,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"QUESTIONABLE","lastName":"Adams","lastNewsDate":1569616953000,"lastVideoDate":1569510647000,"outlooks":{"outlooksByWeek":{"1":"Adams has emerged as the go-to target on the Packers offense, which is a great place to be when Aaron Rodgers is under center. His 2018 can certainly be classified as a breakout, as he set career-high marks in catches, targets, yards and touchdowns. He has proven he can score just about a touchdown-per-game over the past three seasons, but things won't come easy against the Bears' talented defense. Still, there's no reason to downgrade Adams or worry about him at all in Week 1. He's locked in as a WR1. ","2":"Adams led the Packers in targets in Week 1, so while his (and his team's) performance surely disappointed, don't lose faith. The Bears are a tough opponent and Thursday games tend to be tricky. That said, don't expect immediate regression to the mean in Week 2, as the Vikings are a tough bunch on defense, as well. They did allow both Julio Jones and Calvin Ridley to find the end zone in Week 1, but the Falcons did not look sharp on offense against this unit -- and the Packers may not, either. Adams is still a WR1, but not the most appealing one due to the quality of opponent.","3":"The Packers offense has one of the toughest schedules to start the season, facing a trio of great defenses -- including Week 3's opponent, Denver. The Broncos allowed Tyrell Williams to go over 100 yards and score in Week 1, but kept Allen Robinson in check in Week 2. That doesn't bode well for Adams. While he could well end up, like Williams,  succeeding in this tough matchup, he could just as easily be like Robinson, which would surely frustrate fantasy managers. He's too good to bench, just don't bank on him to carry your team in Week 3.","4":"After three straight games against great pass defenses, Adams will finally get a chance to deliver on his preseason promise in Week 4. Adams has split targets with Marquez Valdes-Scantling so far this season -- both players have 19 of them on the year -- but that shouldn't cause any alarm for those who drafted him early. The Fresno State product is the unquestioned top option in the Green Bay passing game and will face an Eagles defense that has allowed a 100-yard receiver in every game this year. Lock him in as a WR1."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":41.139318885448915,"averageDraftPosition":14.797483123593633,"percentChange":-0.0021519802468503713,"percentOwned":99.8704167028598,"percentStarted":97.05240718774341},"proTeamId":9,"rankings":{"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":50,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":35.666666666666664,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":5.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":6.166666666666667,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":5.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":5.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":27,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23}]},"seasonOutlook":"Adams took his game to another level in 2018. In fact, before missing Week 17 because of an injury, Adams was the No. 1 scoring fantasy wide receiver. Incredibly, Adams ranked in the top 18 among wide receivers in all but one week last season (27th in Week 4) aside from the one week he missed. In addition to catching 13 touchdowns (second most), Adams ranked fourth at the position in routes (618), fourth in targets (164), fifth in receptions (111) and sixth in receiving yards (1,386). Adams has hauled in 35 touchdowns over the past three seasons, which trails only Antonio Brown for most in the league. Adams has done this damage despite missing at least one game three of the past four seasons. The 26-year-old soaked up a massive 30 percent target share last season and has little competition for targets again in 2019. He's a fine choice in the middle of the first round.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":13.898588946800002,"appliedStats":{"53":43.05,"72":-0.722847674,"42":108.45,"43":57.0,"44":0.686441876,"63":0.01524},"appliedTotal":208.47883420200003,"externalId":"2018","id":"102018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"41":86.1,"42":1084.5,"43":9.5,"44":0.343220938,"45":0.181177118,"46":0.118399247,"47":216.0,"48":108.0,"49":54.0,"50":43.0,"51":21.0,"52":10.0,"53":86.1,"54":17.0,"55":8.0,"56":3.351355575,"57":0.104,"58":134.6,"60":12.595818815331011,"61":67.78328238,"62":0.343220938,"63":0.00254,"67":0.645399708,"68":0.6,"71":0.361423837,"72":0.361423837,"73":0.361423837,"210":15.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":5.0,"42":18.0},"appliedTotal":23.0,"externalId":"401127863","id":"01401127863","proTeamId":9,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"41":10.0,"42":180.0,"47":36.0,"48":18.0,"49":9.0,"210":1.0,"50":7.0,"51":3.0,"52":1.0,"53":10.0,"54":2.0,"55":1.0,"56":1.0,"58":15.0,"59":99.0,"60":18.0,"156":1.0,"61":180.0}},{"appliedAverage":15.596098439666667,"appliedStats":{"53":48.862069945,"72":-0.747627988,"42":120.2214072,"43":64.57461222,"44":1.01527498,"63":0.015740238},"appliedTotal":233.941476595,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"42":1202.214072,"43":10.76243537,"44":0.50763749,"45":0.191386326,"46":0.125070964,"47":240.0,"48":120.0,"49":60.0,"50":48.0,"51":24.0,"53":97.72413989,"54":19.0,"55":9.0,"56":4.224097847,"57":0.130642201,"58":147.316572,"60":12.30211975,"61":77.40613742,"62":0.50763749,"63":0.002623373,"67":0.667524989,"68":0.667524989,"71":0.373813994,"72":0.373813994,"73":0.373813994,"210":15.53125}},{"appliedStats":{"53":3.0742492625,"72":-0.062445672,"42":7.774943361,"43":3.3444091019999997,"44":0.055852548,"63":0.001314},"appliedTotal":14.188322601500001,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"42":77.74943361,"43":0.557401517,"44":0.027926274,"45":0.012908861,"46":0.008435941,"47":15.0,"48":7.0,"49":3.0,"50":3.0,"51":1.0,"53":6.148498525,"54":1.0,"56":0.28364683,"57":0.00877,"58":9.328111442,"60":12.64527157,"61":77.74943361,"62":0.027926274,"63":2.19E-4,"67":0.055755064,"68":0.055755064,"71":0.031222836,"72":0.031222836,"73":0.031222836,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":2.805790177,"72":-0.057120814,"42":7.021262662,"43":3.559957368,"44":0.056792696,"63":0.0012000000000000001},"appliedTotal":13.387882089,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"42":70.21262662,"43":0.593326228,"44":0.028396348,"45":0.012340654,"46":0.008064618,"47":14.0,"48":7.0,"49":3.0,"50":2.0,"51":1.0,"53":5.611580354,"54":1.0,"56":0.227088731,"57":0.00702,"58":8.518751415,"60":12.51209502,"61":70.21262662,"62":0.028396348,"63":2.0E-4,"67":0.051000727,"68":0.051000727,"71":0.028560407,"72":0.028560407,"73":0.028560407,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":2.0,"42":5.6000000000000005},"appliedTotal":7.6000000000000005,"externalId":"401127925","id":"01401127925","proTeamId":9,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"41":4.0,"42":56.0,"47":11.0,"48":5.0,"49":2.0,"50":2.0,"51":1.0,"53":4.0,"58":4.0,"59":10.0,"60":14.0,"61":56.0,"155":1.0,"210":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":14.028679007076923,"appliedStats":{"53":40.27023128,"72":-0.81798886,"42":101.62004710000001,"43":40.612548954,"44":0.670767034,"63":0.017221583999999998},"appliedTotal":182.372827092,"externalId":"2019","id":"122019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{"42":1016.200471,"43":6.768758159,"44":0.335383517,"45":0.16633611,"46":0.108700648,"47":203.0,"48":101.0,"49":50.0,"50":40.0,"51":20.0,"53":80.54046256,"54":16.0,"55":8.0,"56":3.725751815,"57":0.115229438,"58":122.247546,"60":12.61726638,"61":78.16926697,"62":0.335383517,"63":0.002870264,"67":0.730347197,"68":0.730347197,"71":0.40899443,"72":0.40899443,"73":0.40899443,"210":13.0}},{"appliedAverage":18.273333333333333,"appliedStats":{"53":55.5,"42":138.6,"43":78.0,"44":2.0},"appliedTotal":274.1,"externalId":"2018","id":"002018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"41":111.0,"42":1386.0,"43":13.0,"44":1.0,"47":271.0,"48":133.0,"49":63.0,"50":48.0,"51":20.0,"52":5.0,"53":111.0,"54":17.0,"55":3.0,"56":5.0,"58":169.0,"60":12.486486486486486,"61":86.625,"62":1.0,"108":1.0,"109":1.0,"155":6.0,"156":9.0,"157":1.0,"174":0.375,"210":15.0}},{"appliedAverage":12.575000000000001,"appliedStats":{"53":12.5,"42":37.800000000000004},"appliedTotal":50.300000000000004,"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"41":25.0,"42":378.0,"108":1.0,"109":1.0,"47":75.0,"48":36.0,"49":17.0,"

any fantasy managers are considering benching Gurley for Week 1, it's not unfair to have doubts about last season's top pick for most drafters. The end of the 2018 campaign was rough for Gurley, who struggled with both injury and poor performances as the season drew to a close. However, he's a workhorse (250-plus carries in each of the past three seasons) who knows how to find the end zone (40 touchdowns combined over the past two seasons). Lock him into your lineup against a solid, but not overwhelming Panthers rushing defense and worry about \"start or sit\" decisions elsewhere.","2":"After ending the first half with just eight yards on five carries, you can be forgiven for worrying if your first-round pick was already a massive mistake. But Gurley came through when his team needed him, rushing for 64 yards in the fourth quarter alone and pacing his team in carries. However, Malcolm Brown saw most of the red-zone work and scored a pair of touchdowns. That's a concerning sign for the Georgia product who doesn't seem at 100% after struggling with injuries down the stretch a year ago. Don't hesitate to start Gurley this week, but don't be surprised if he's not the same \"bell cow\" we've seen in years past.","3":"It may appear as though Gurley's volume is down, as the 25-year-old appears to be limited due to the same sort of injuries that slowed him down at the end of 2018. However, with 30 carries and five targets so far, he's actually just shy of his career average for carries-per-game (18) and is right on track in terms of targets. He's also gaining yards at a very efficient rate (5.3 yards-per-attempt). Week 3 brings a matchup with the Browns, who allowed Derrick Henry to find paydirt in Week 1 before keeping the Luke Falk-led Jets in check in Week 2. There are no guarantees that this will be a huge game for Gurley, but something like Henry's 84 yards and a score should be expected.","4":"Gurley still gets tons of touches in the high-powered Rams offense, but those who drafted him have to be feeling a bit uneasy about his lack of production through three weeks. Sure, he has found the end zone once, but otherwise he's been limited to lots of short gains. He is seeing only around 14 carries-per-game. Combined with his struggles at the end of last season, there's every reason to worry he's taken a step back, with injuries likely to blame. Regardless, when evaluating him for Week 4, the Buccaneers defense poses a tough test, having yet to allow an RB rushing score this season. Tampa Bay has conceded only 160 RB rushing yards on 59 carries over three games. Gurley should still start, but he's more of a high-end RB2 this week."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":36.37616099071207,"averageDraftPosition":16.57465422429595,"percentChange":-0.01887466026748541,"percentOwned":99.84542607863548,"percentStarted":95.17510071156691},"proTeamId":14,"rankings":{"0":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":17,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":6.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":6.166666666666667,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":17,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":17,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":17,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":12.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":14.833333333333334,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":12.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":12.666666666666666,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":20,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":20,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":20,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":8.75,"

Gurley is expected to be fully healthy for 2019, of course, which means you may actually be able to get a discount on a player who scored 21 touchdowns in 14 games last season. The 24-year-old workhorse missed two games but still ranked fourth among backs in snaps, touches and scrimmage yards. He has paced running backs in fantasy points per game and top-10 fantasy weeks each of the past two seasons. Concerns about Gurley's knee remain, which has knocked down his fantasy stock, but his massive fantasy upside makes him a fine choice in Round 2.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":20.837218917857143,"appliedStats":{"53":33.55,"72":-6.943852598,"24":127.44000000000001,"25":63.0,"26":0.373159524,"42":58.39,"43":15.600000000000001,"44":0.14089524,"63":0.17086268400000001},"appliedTotal":291.72106485,"externalId":"2018","id":"102018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":283.6,"24":1274.4,"25":10.5,"26":0.186579762,"27":254.0,"28":127.0,"29":63.0,"30":50.0,"31":25.0,"32":12.0,"33":56.0,"34":28.0,"35":0.605476869,"36":0.423833809,"37":4.457086866,"38":0.152,"39":4.493653032440056,"40":84.60929436,"41":67.1,"42":583.9,"43":2.6,"44":0.07044762,"45":0.070392637,"46":0.046001588,"47":116.0,"48":58.0,"49":29.0,"50":23.0,"51":11.0,"52":5.0,"53":67.1,"54":13.0,"55":6.0,"56":0.651053839,"57":0.020135686,"58":90.4,"60":8.701937406855441,"61":38.76216279,"62":0.257027382,"63":0.028477114,"66":5.858813448,"67":1.387271631,"68":7.2,"70":2.695054186,"71":0.776872113,"72":3.471926299,"73":3.471926299,"210":14.0}},{"appliedAverage":18.188893372357146,"appliedStats":{"53":21.543711905,"72":-2.026001362,"24":105.2755142,"25":72.62427318,"26":0.663790532,"42":39.83191235,"43":16.421656757999997,"44":0.259458534,"63":0.050191116},"appliedTotal":254.64450721300003,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":227.69767,"24":1052.755142,"25":12.10404553,"26":0.331895266,"27":210.0,"28":105.0,"29":52.0,"30":42.0,"31":21.0,"33":45.0,"34":22.0,"35":0.472681669,"36":0.330877168,"37":3.047905605,"38":0.104013325,"39":4.623477885,"40":74.53133747,"42":398.3191235,"43":2.736942793,"44":0.129729267,"45":0.08887161,"46":0.058077597,"47":79.0,"48":39.0,"49":19.0,"50":15.0,"51":7.0,"53":43.08742381,"54":8.0,"55":4.0,"56":0.239251211,"57":0.007399522,"58":58.4299473,"60":9.244440449,"61":28.19958396,"62":0.461624533,"63":0.008365186,"66":1.789851011,"67":0.338695029,"68":2.12854604,"70":0.823331465,"71":0.189669216,"72":1.013000681,"73":1.013000681,"210":14.125}},{"appliedStats":{"53":0.8530094965,"72":-0.143572044,"24":6.911919341,"25":5.006368512,"26":0.040480536,"42":1.5162677420000001,"43":0.54584802,"44":0.00937509,"63":0.003606},"appliedTotal":14.743302693500002,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":15.78812659,"24":69.11919341,"25":0.834394752,"26":0.020240268,"27":13.0,"28":6.0,"29":3.0,"30":2.0,"31":1.0,"33":3.0,"34":1.0,"35":0.033181981,"36":0.023227387,"37":0.209065893,"38":0.00713,"39":4.377922424,"40":69.11919341,"42":15.16267742,"43":0.09097467,"44":0.004687545,"45":0.004715264,"46":0.003081425,"47":3.0,"48":1.0,"53":1.706018993,"56":0.005867072,"57":1.81E-4,"58":2.30530656,"60":8.887754172,"61":15.16267742,"62":0.024927813,"63":6.01E-4,"66":0.137914258,"67":0.014902613,"68":0.152816871,"70":0.063440559,"71":0.008345463,"72":0.071786022,"73":0.071786022,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":1.23927822,"72":-0.131400884,"24":5.824627361000001,"25":3.68973825,"26":0.03219331,"42":2.2134267210000003,"43":0.730545444,"44":0.011983096,"63":0.003256206},"appliedTotal":13.613647724000002,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":13.23479123,"24":58.24627361,"25":0.614956375,"26":0.016096655,"27":11.0,"28":5.0,"29":2.0,"30":2.0,"31":1.0,"33":2.0,"34":1.0,"35":0.027242427,"36":0.019069699,"37":0.14839658,"38":0.005064206,"39":4.400996781,"40":58.24627361,"42":22.13426721,"43":0.121757574,"44":0.005991548,"45":0.004760299,"46":0.003110855,"47":4.0,"48":2.0,"49":1.0,"53":2.47855644,"56":0.011394972,"57":3.52422E-4,"58":3.357917989,"60":8.930305906,"61":22.13426721,"62":0.022088204,"63":5.42701E-4,"66":0.116309812,"67":0.021782016,"68":0.138091828,"70":0.053502513,"71":0.012197929,"72":0.065700442,"73":0.065700442,"210":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":14.191526736538462,"appliedStats":{"53":11.345736615,"72":-1.822703994,"24":87.22619906,"25":60.1082532,"26":0.498093426,"42":20.142333320000002,"43":6.830646246000001,"44":0.115589082,"63":0.04570062},"appliedTotal":184.489847575,"externalId":"2019","id":"122019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{"23":199.1790975,"24":872.2619906,"25":10.0180422,"26":0.249046713,"27":174.0,"28":87.0,"29":43.0,"30":34.0,"31":17.0,"33":39.0,"34":19.0,"35":0.41724119,"36":0.292068833,"37":2.573337686,"38":0.087818142,"39":4.379284781,"40":67.0970762,"42":201.4233332,"43":1.138441041,"44":0.057794541,"45":0.061171792,"46":0.039975766,"47":40.0,"48":20.0,"49":10.0,"50":8.0,"51":4.0,"53":22.69147323,"54":4.0,"55":2.0,"56":0.0786857,"57":0.002433578,"58":30.66249141,"60":8.8766089,"61":15.49410256,"62":0.306841254,"63":0.00761677,"66":1.739892142,"67":0.198217165,"68":1.938109307,"70":0.800350385,"71":0.111001612,"72":0.911351997,"73":0.911351997,"210":13.0}},{"appliedStats":

season cut short due to injury, but was looking like a solid RB2 option up until that point. Healthy and ready to go for Week 1, he's got competition for touches but should be the lead back for Detroit as he looks to prove he can sustain his 5.4 yards-per-carry average and healthy pass-catching workload. The main risk comes in the form of competition from C.J. Anderson, but a matchup with the Cardinals (second-most points allowed to running backs last season) should only serve to increase your confidence locking Kerryon in as an RB2.","2":"Johnson led the Lions in both rushing attempts and yards in Week 1, but he unfortunately was only targeted twice in the passing game. He hauled in both of those chances, but another pair of passes went the way of late addition J.D. McKissic, who appears to have a role as a change-of-pace pass-catcher out of the backfield. That will slightly lower Johnson's offensive upside, but he's clearly the team's first-choice back ahead of C.J. Anderson. In Week 2, he'll face a Chargers defense which allowed Marlon Mack to break free for 175 yards in Week 1, so consider Johnson a solid RB2, although maybe with a bitof a lower ceiling than previously thought, due to McKissic's presence.","3":"Johnson is absolutely the lead back in Detroit, as C.J. Anderson lags behind him in both snaps and carries. While Ty Johnson and JD McKissic also see a handful of snaps, the top spot and the bulk of the work go to the second-year Auburn product. He's yet to deliver much as a runner, however, averaging only 3.2 yards-per-attempt. He's also seen only five targets, so while his receiving score in Week 2 was a nice boost, that's not a big part of his game yet. The Eagles have been one of the toughest matchups for opposing backs this season -- apart from allowing receiving specialist Chris Thompson to haul in seven passes in Week 1 -- so this is an unappealing spot for Johnson. He's a flex option in Week 3.","4":"Johnson is the unquestioned lead back in Detroit at this point. C.J. Anderson is no longer with the team and backups Ty Johnson and J.D. McKissic only see a few snaps per game. In Week 3 against Philadelphia, Kerryon saw a ton of carries, even though he wasn't able to do much with them. That is an encouraging sign that Detroit trusts in him -- despite the lack of results. He even managed to find the end zone to salvage his day from a fantasy perspective.

was one of the youngest players selected in the 2018 draft, but that didn't stop the Auburn product from making an immediate impact. Despite playing only 51 percent of the snaps, Johnson ranked 14th among running backs in fantasy points prior to suffering a season-ending injury in Week 11. Johnson averaged 5.4 YPC (fifth-best) and caught 84 percent (seventh-best) of his 38 targets. Johnson will defer some touches to C.J. Anderson and PJ Johnson this season, but his averages of 12.5 carries and 4.0 targets per game after Week 1 last season will suffice to allow him RB2 production. Plus, there's room for more if he continues to play at a high level and with Theo Riddick gone. Johnson is a solid RB2 and breakout candidate.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":13.5610741429,"appliedStats":{"53":14.792710275,"72":-1.75448152,"24":67.63858332,"25":25.138705758,"26":0.369728286,"42":23.99886194,"43":5.305783854,"44":0.07731045,"63":0.043539066},"appliedTotal":135.610741429,"externalId":"2018","id":"102018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":166.3662622,"24":676.3858332,"25":4.189784293,"26":0.184864143,"27":135.0,"28":67.0,"29":33.0,"30":27.0,"31":13.0,"32":6.0,"33":33.0,"34":16.0,"35":0.334554849,"36":0.234188394,"37":1.257237062,"38":0.042904677,"39":4.065643023144148,"40":44.90528353,"41":29.58542055,"42":239.9886194,"43":0.884297309,"44":0.038655225,"45":0.055819719,"46":0.036478187,"47":47.0,"48":23.0,"49":11.0,"50":9.0,"51":4.0,"52":2.0,"53":29.58542055,"54":5.0,"55":2.0,"56":0.092727773,"57":0.002867869,"58":39.33444912,"60":8.111719047373827,"61":15.9328544,"62":0.223519368,"63":0.007256511,"66":1.567658875,"67":0.278781566,"68":1.846440441,"70":0.721123083,"71":0.156117677,"72":0.87724076,"73":0.87724076,"210":10.0}},{"appliedAverage":13.903072714466669,"appliedStats":{"53":27.593711755,"72":-2.078799724,"24":96.74133472,"25":32.93446239,"26":0.466582514,"42":39.78919151,"43":12.815095878000001,"44":0.23350697,"63":0.051004704000000005},"appliedTotal":208.54609071700003,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":213.6879668,"24":967.4133472,"25":5.489077065,"26":0.233291257,"27":193.0,"28":96.0,"29":48.0,"30":38.0,"31":19.0,"33":42.0,"34":21.0,"35":0.440491081,"36":0.308343757,"37":2.5808079,"38":0.088073072,"39":4.52722426,"40":64.22661226,"42":397.8919151,"43":2.135849313,"44":0.116753485,"45":0.045663459,"46":0.02984107,"47":79.0,"48":39.0,"49":19.0,"50":15.0,"51":7.0,"53":55.18742351,"54":11.0,"55":5.0,"56":0.239302823,"57":0.007401118,"58":68.93909001,"60":7.209829518,"61":26.41606075,"62":0.350044742,"63":0.008500784,"66":1.71907739,"67":0.443971897,"68":2.163049287,"70":0.790775599,"71":0.248624262,"72":1.039399862,"73":1.039399862,"210":15.0625}},{"appliedStats":{"53":1.2752135125,"72":-0.098975106,"24":6.238550719,"25":3.2946721500000002,"26":0.049585374,"42":1.947963257,"43":0.698528382,"44":0.012262202,"63":0.002454},"appliedTotal":13.4202544905,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":14.27700343,"24":62.38550719,"25":0.549112025,"26":0.024792687,"27":12.0,"28":6.0,"29":3.0,"30":2.0,"31":1.0,"33":2.0,"34":1.0,"35":0.029640101,"36":0.020748071,"37":0.170270204,"38":0.00581,"39":4.36964994,"40":62.38550719,"42":19.47963257,"43":0.116421397,"44":0.006131101,"45":0.003488215,"46":0.002279548,"47":3.0,"48":1.0,"53":2.550427025,"56":0.008793884,"57":2.72E-4,"58":3.179155715,"60":7.637792564,"61":19.47963257,"62":0.030923788,"63":4.09E-4,"66":0.088364675,"67":0.015785361,"68":0.104150036,"70":0.04064775,"71":0.008839802,"72":0.049487553,"73":0.049487553,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":1.558050335,"72":-0.127598726,"24":5.7037992090000005,"25":1.5818301000000001,"26":0.026284042,"42":2.3853351020000004,"43":0.5347789679999999,"44":0.00942273,"63":0.00313872},"appliedTotal":11.675040480000003,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":13.02931569,"24":57.03799209,"25":0.26363835,"26":0.013142021,"27":11.0,"28":5.0,"29":2.0,"30":2.0,"31":1.0,"33":2.0,"34":1.0,"35":0.026774066,"36":0.018741846,"37":0.142294905,"38":0.00486,"39":4.377665982,"40":57.03799209,"42":23.85335102,"43":0.089129828,"44":0.004711365,"45":0.003439851,"46":0.002247943,"47":4.0,"48":2.0,"49":1.0,"53":3.11610067,"56":0.013470603,"57":4.16617E-4,"58":3.906288366,"60":7.65487176,"61":23.85335102,"62":0.017853386,"63":5.2312E-4,"66":0.107418992,"67":0.025690405,"68":0.133109397,"70":0.049412736,"71":0.014386627,"72":0.063799363,"73":0.063799363,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":0.5,"24":3.6,"25":6.0,"42":0.7000000000000001},"appliedTotal":10.799999999999999,"externalId":"401127959","id":"01401127959","proTeamId":8,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":20.0,"24":36.0,"25":1.0,"27":7.0,"28":3.0,"29":1.0,"30":1.0,"33":4.0,"34":2.0,"39":1.8,"40":36.0,"41":1.0,"42":7.0,"47":1.0,"53":1.0,"58":1.0,"60":7.0,"61":7.0,"155":1.0,"158":6.0,"179":1.0,"210":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":12.45643745476923,"appliedStats":{"53":15.91763688,"72":-1.334248884,"24":83.34831276,"25":31.900225380000002,"26":0.503773876,"42":24.268209920000004,"43":7.169412714,"44":0.127176922,"63":0.033187344},"appliedTotal":161.93368691199998,"externalId":"2019","id":"122019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{"23":195.5629589,"24":833.4831276,"25":5.31670423,"26":0.251886938,"27":166.0,"28":83.0,"29":41.0,"30":33.0,"31":16.0,"33":39.0,"34":19

He entered the season bothered by a hamstring injury, but played through it and seemed fine. There's no reason to be worried about him in Week 2 and beyond. He's a flex option against a fairly tough Packers defense.","3":"Diggs has lagged behind fellow receiver Adam Thielen a bit in volume this season, but not by enough to cause panic among those who invested in the Maryland product. The main cause for concern is the run-first nature of the Vikings offense. However, when they do pass, it's usually going to Diggs or Thielen. They'll get their numbers, even in a low-volume offense. The Raiders looked decent on defense in Week 1 against the Broncos, but then in Week 2 allowed Patrick Mahomes to post eye-popping numbers in the second quarter alone. Kirk Cousins and the Vikings might not recreate what the Chiefs did, but there's reason for optimism that the passing game can get something going in Week 3. Consider Diggs as a solid WR3/flex pick.","4":"Diggs saw only three targets in Week 3 as the Vikings again turned to the ground game in a victory. The Maryland product saw seven looks in a Week 2 loss to the Packers. It appears that the Vikings are only going to throw -- and subsequently throw to Diggs -- when the score absolutely dictates that they do so. So, while he may have commanded a fairly high pick in drafts, he's simply not seeing the sort of volume required to be a starting fantasy receiver. This is especially true against a Chicago defense that is talented from front to back. Diggs is a risky flex play (at best) in Week 4."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":16.91486068111455,"averageDraftPosition":49.78795200799867,"percentChange":-2.906126709684159,"percentOwned":95.19543359358869,"percentStarted":42.48162002907759},"proTeamId":16,"rankings":{"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":17,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":17,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":17,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":15.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":15.666666666666666,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":17,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":14.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":14.666666666666666,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":27,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":20,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":27,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":17,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":21,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":22,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":22.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":19.333333333333332,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":41,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":37,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":39,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":37,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":74,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":33,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":32,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":33,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":40,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":74,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":39,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":74,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":38,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":37.

has been a strong fantasy force when healthy, ranking no lower than 14th in fantasy points per game during each of the past three seasons. \"When healthy\" has been the key, however, as Diggs has yet to make it through a full 16-game season, missing nine games in four seasons. Diggs did manage a career-best 10th place fantasy finish last season, however, fueled by top-8 finishes in targets (148), receptions (102) and touchdowns (9). Primarily a short-area target, Diggs' 10.0 YPR was sixth lowest and his 6.9 YPT 16th lowest at the position. Even with Minnesota looking to run more often, the 25-year-old should get enough volume to allow strong WR2 value.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":12.403064949333334,"appliedStats":{"53":41.333173015,"72":-0.782683704,"24":4.718447865000001,"25":1.040438478,"26":0.010019524,"42":104.45050400000001,"43":34.851519552,"44":0.407804542,"63":0.016750968},"appliedTotal":186.04597424000002,"externalId":"2018","id":"102018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":8.291716751,"24":47.18447865,"25":0.173406413,"26":0.005009762,"27":9.0,"28":4.0,"29":2.0,"30":1.0,"33":1.0,"35":0.015279462,"36":0.010695624,"37":0.005797549,"38":1.97848E-4,"39":5.690556017161278,"40":3.132579495,"41":82.66634603,"42":1044.50504,"43":5.808586592,"44":0.203902271,"45":0.225664166,"46":0.147471532,"47":208.0,"48":104.0,"49":52.0,"50":41.0,"51":20.0,"52":10.0,"53":82.66634603,"54":16.0,"55":8.0,"56":3.066522364,"57":0.094840898,"58":122.7081058,"60":12.635190620629878,"61":69.34473297,"62":0.208912033,"63":0.002791828,"66":0.064758887,"67":0.645629936,"68":0.710388823,"70":0.029789088,"71":0.361552764,"72":0.391341852,"73":0.391341852,"210":15.0}},{"appliedAverage":11.343214826687499,"appliedStats":{"53":43.389925025,"72":-0.730845442,"24":4.80102093,"25":0.922457844,"26":0.011992402,"42":93.48781048000001,"43":38.972278914,"44":0.621167548,"63":0.015629526},"appliedTotal":181.49143722699998,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":8.261852011,"24":48.0102093,"25":0.153742974,"26":0.005996201,"27":9.0,"28":4.0,"29":2.0,"30":1.0,"33":1.0,"35":0.015224147,"36":0.010656903,"37":0.00601081,"38":2.05126E-4,"39":5.811071082,"40":3.000638081,"42":934.8781048,"43":6.495379819,"44":0.310583774,"45":0.125531234,"46":0.082034662,"47":186.0,"48":93.0,"49":46.0,"50":37.0,"51":18.0,"53":86.77985005,"54":17.0,"55":8.0,"56":2.33089907,"57":0.072089662,"58":126.7186774,"60":10.77298594,"61":58.42988155,"62":0.316579976,"63":0.002604921,"66":0.057618924,"67":0.605210743,"68":0.662829668,"70":0.026504705,"71":0.338918016,"72":0.365422721,"73":0.365422721,"210":16.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":3.5,"72":-2.0,"42":10.8},"appliedTotal":12.3,"externalId":"401128093","id":"01401128093","proTeamId":16,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"68":1.0,"72":1.0,"41":7.0,"73":1.0,"42":108.0,"47":21.0,"48":10.0,"49":5.0,"210":1.0,"50":4.0,"51":2.0,"52":1.0,"53":7.0,"54":1.0,"56":1.0,"58":7.0,"59":35.0,"60":15.429,"156":1.0,"61":108.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":1.5,"42":1.5},"appliedTotal":3.0,"externalId":"401127956","id":"01401127956","proTeamId":16,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"41":3.0,"42":15.0,"47":3.0,"48":1.0,"53":3.0,"58":3.0,"59":2.0,"60":5.0,"61":15.0,"155":1.0,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":2.1254760005,"72":-0.052302612,"24":0.3045758605,"25":0.070505094,"26":5.55978E-4,"42":5.04684383,"43":1.278727362,"44":0.030731332,"63":0.001122},"appliedTotal":8.806234845,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":0.571453621,"24":3.045758605,"25":0.011750849,"26":2.77989E-4,"35":0.001053531,"36":7.37472E-4,"37":3.84E-4,"38":1.31E-5,"39":5.32984392,"40":3.045758605,"42":50.4684383,"43":0.213121227,"44":0.015365666,"45":0.009760351,"46":0.006378389,"47":10.0,"48":5.0,"49":2.0,"50":2.0,"51":1.0,"53":4.250952001,"56":0.098792754,"57":0.003055446,"58":6.483207461,"60":11.87226727,"61":50.4684383,"62":0.015643655,"63":1.87E-4,"66":0.005653419,"67":0.042054881,"68":0.047708301,"70":0.002600573,"71":0.023550734,"72":0.026151306,"73":0.026151306,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":2.1055609585,"72":-0.052572442,"24":0.3457244521,"25":0.088422876,"26":8.53074E-4,"42":5.4510165740000005,"43":2.386662006,"44":0.045095844,"63":0.001133418},"appliedTotal":10.3718967606,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":0.636711584,"24":3.457244521,"25":0.014737146,"26":4.26537E-4,"35":0.001174545,"36":8.22182E-4,"37":4.98764E-4,"38":1.70209E-5,"39":5.42984392,"40":3.457244521,"42":54.51016574,"43":0.397777001,"44":0.022547922,"45":0.013408553,"46":0.008762489,"47":10.0,"48":5.0,"49":2.0,"50":2.0,"51":1.0,"53":4.211121917,"56":0.121257626,"57":0.003750236,"58":6.47802196,"60":12.94433332,"61":54.51016574,"62":0.022974459,"63":1.88903E-4,"66":0.006313094,"67":0.041753924,"68":0.048067018,"70":0.002904023,"71":0.023382198,"72":0.026286221,"73":0.026286221,"210":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":9.322749535076923,"appliedStats":{"53":26.529197935,"72":-0.658534718,"24":4.1957748189999995,"25":1.337255538,"26":0.010097,"42":66.03536505,"43":23.17757403,"44":0.554826504,"63":0.014187798000000001},"appliedTotal":121.195743956,"externalId":"2019","id":"122019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{"23":7.76085266,"24":41.95774819,"25":0.22

64-821-10 rookie season and should continue garnering plenty of attention from Matt Ryan. Likely to avoid Vikings CB Xavier Rhodes most of the time in Week 1, the sophomore could outperform top Atlanta WR Julio Jones, giving Ridley a strong WR2 ceiling in the season opener.","2":"Ridley found the end zone in his first 2019 action, despite falling behind both Julio Jones and Austin Hooper in targets. The big-play receiver averaged 10.7 yards-per-target, reflecting his weekly upside. That sets up well in Week 2 against the Eagles, who just let Washington QB Case Keenum work for a career-high in passing yards in Week 1 and were often torched by rookie deep threat Terry McLaurin. That fits well with Ridley's profile, making him a strong fantasy WR3 with tons of upside.","3":"Ridley's 8-105-1 Week 2 line marked his second straight outing with a touchdown to start the season. Julio Jones should draw much of the Colts' defensive attention in Week 3, which could leave Ridley open for more 1-on-1 matchups. He's earned Matt Ryan's attention in his own right since his 2018 rookie season, though, and he'll make for a solid fantasy WR3 on the heels of his 16 targets over the first two weeks.","4":"The Colts shut down Ridley for just one target in Week 3, far below his 8.0 average over the first two games. The Titans have allowed three touchdowns to wideouts over the past two weeks, and Ridley should remain in the fantasy WR3 realm for his big-play ability."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":6.766253869969041,"averageDraftPosition":87.05308775731311,"percentChange":-1.6373276882901706,"percentOwned":93.25655740039302,"percentStarted":40.14332298578874},"proTeamId":1,"rankings":{"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":30,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":32,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":30,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":29,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":33,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":38,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":35,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":32,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":30,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":34,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":31.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":32.666666666666664,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":22,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":24,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":22,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":21,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":23,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":24,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":24,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":23.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":24.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":31,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":29,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":32,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":29,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":24,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":31,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":28,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":29,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":31,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":36,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":28.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":31.166666666666668,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":28,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":26,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":30,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":26,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":57,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":27,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":29,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":30,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":28,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":57,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":28,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":57,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":29,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":27.75,"pub

The latter is notable, as Ridley was limited to five end zone targets and posted a 4.1 OTD. The 24-year-old is an obvious strong bet for touchdown regression this season, but it's possible he sees an increase in targets in his second season.

from the Bears' third-round pick to their lead running back in a hurry, as the team looks to replace the work done by Jordan Howard (who has been traded to the Eagles). As such, look for the Iowa State product to handle most of the carries while teammate Tarik Cohen provies a change of pace and leads the way in terms of receptions out of the backfield. A healthy workload is in store for Montgomery, so consider him as a borderline RB2, or maybe a bit higher if you play in a non-PPR league.","2":"Montgomery was viewed by most as the running back to start behind Tarik Cohen in the Bears backfield, but he was outsnapped and lagged behind in opportunites compared to veteran Mike Davis. Davis had one fewer carry than Montgomery, but saw six more targets in the passing game. With two players splitting this role as the \"traditional\" compliment to Cohen, there's a lot of uncertainy here. That means Montogmery is going to be tough to trust in fantasy, even in a now-appealing matchup with a Broncos defense that allowed Josh Jacobs to score twice in Week 1. He's a risky flex pick for Week 2.","3":"Now that's more like it! Montgomery didn't get much of a chance to show what he can do in his NFL debut, receiving only six carries against the Packers in Week 1 and being outsnapped by veteran Mike Davis. The script was flipped in Week 2, with the Iowa State rookie seeing more snaps than Davis and picking up 18 carries along the way. He still didn't play on a majority of Chicago's snaps, which is concerning for his long-term volume, but he's looking more like the lead back everyone expected to see. In Week 3, he gets an appealing matchup with a Washington defense which allowed 111 yards and a score to Ezekiel Elliott just a week ago. He's solidly in the flex discussion for his third professional game.","4":"Montomgery had his best game as a pro in Week 3, picking up 67 yards on 13 carries for over 5.0 YPA. Yet, that's still not a great total for a starting running back -- especially one who will see limited action in the passing game with Tarik Cohen present. Even worse for Week 4, the Vikings come to town with their solid run defense. While the Packers' Aaron Jones did rush for 116 yards and a score in Week 2, no other back has eclipsed 44 yards in a game against them and Jones is the only one to have found paydirt as a runner. With that in mind, keep Montgomery as more of a speculative flex play, and consider other options for Week 4."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":5.085139318885449,"averageDraftPosition":95.52354362863572,"percentChange":-0.5903021472508385,"percentOwned":93.67990647551674,"percentStarted":47.30689928176386},"proTeamId":3,"rankings":{"0":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":34,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"1":[],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":35,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":30,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":35,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":26,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":27,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":27,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":28,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":29,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":34,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":29.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":30.333333333333332,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":29,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":21,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":21,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":21,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":21,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":21,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":24,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":20.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":21.833333333333332,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":21,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":21,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":21,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":20,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":21,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":71,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":22,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":26,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":71,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":71,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":20.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":23.833333333333332,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":37,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":71,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":20,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}]},"seasonOutlook":"The Bears selected Montgomery in the third round of April's draft to help replace Jordan Howard, whom they traded to the Eagles. Montgomery figures to immediately play a significant role along with change-of-pace back Tarik Cohen. He is one of the biggest backs in this class (5-foot-10, 222 pounds). His on-field profile is very similar to Kareem Hunt's, as he lacks some speed (4.63 40-yard dash) and explosiveness, but makes up for it with a combination of power, balance and especially elusiveness. The Iowa State product evaded a tackle once for every 5.1 touches last season (second best in the class) and is also a good receiver and blocker. Montgomery is a potential workhorse and, though he'll defer a lot of targets to Cohen this season, Montgomery could push for 200-plus carries.

quarterback throwing 25 touchdowns and only two interceptions had a letdown of a season, but for Aaron Rodgers, 2018 could be classified as a disappointment. Normally the perennial All-Pro is tossing 30-40 touchdowns-per-season and sitting atop the fantasy leaderboards by the end of the campaign. He'll look to get back to those heights in 2019 starting with a matchup against the \"aggressive but not unbreakable\" Bears defense, who allowed the fifth-fewest points to quarterbacks last season. It's not a great matchup, but he's still a QB1, regardless of the opponent.","2":"Rodgers and the Packers offense did not impress in Week 1, but the Bears have a solid defense and Thursday games tend to be a bit on the ugly side. He did attempt 30 passes and ran the ball three times, so it's not as if Green Bay doesn't trust their veteran signal-caller and team leader. He's going to have better games than this. Heck, odds are he'll have about 15 of them. That starts in Week 2 against the Vikings, who are solid defensively but did allow Rodgers to throw for nearly 300 yards and a touchdown almost exactly a year ago (Week 2 of 2018). The upside isn't high, but this guy is a QB1 until further notice.","3":"Those who drafted Rodgers won't be thrilled with his performance so far, but his two starts have come against two tough defenses. To come away with three touchdowns and no interceptions is a credit to the 35-year-old's ability under center. Things get no easier in Week 3, however, as the Packers host the Broncos and their elite defense. Over two games, Denver has allowed only 379 passing yards and a single touchdown. Rodgers is still a must-start, but wait for better matchups before getting too angry about his lack of fantasy returns. ","4":"It's unusual to have to scroll so far down the scoring leaders page to find Rodgers but, after three weeks, Green Bay's quarterback has been outscored by some surprising names, such as Gardner Minshew and Case Keenum. That said, he's faced three of the toughest pass defenses in the NFL, something that changes in Week 4. The Eagles allowed Keenum to pass for 380 yards and three scores to open the season and then conceded another three TD tosses to Matt Ryan in Week 2. They kept Matthew Stafford in check in Week 3, but there's more than enough proof here that the Eagles are a suspect pass defense -- or at least suspect enough for Rodgers to thrive. Lock him in as your QB1."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":5.13312693498452,"averageDraftPosition":62.863715928982245,"percentChange":-0.5416864310340799,"percentOwned":97.73000238496132,"percentStarted":66.74492767283472},"proTeamId":9,"rankings":{"1":[],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":17,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":17,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":17,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":12.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":15.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":17,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":7.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":7.666666666666667,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}],"4":[]},"seasonOutlook":"Rodgers enters 2019 off a relatively disappointing season in which he was limited to six top-10 fantasy weeks (eight QBs had more).

option.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":19.535956280375,"appliedStats":{"19":2.40797104,"4":134.0,"20":-18.4,"8":160.0,"72":-6.815843524,"24":30.880000000000003,"25":10.2,"26":0.135149792,"63":0.168023178},"appliedTotal":312.575300486,"externalId":"2018","id":"102018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":565.0,"1":358.8,"2":206.2,"3":4018.7,"4":33.5,"5":803.0,"6":401.0,"7":200.0,"8":160.0,"9":80.0,"10":40.0,"11":71.0,"12":35.0,"13":41.0,"14":20.0,"15":3.400173373,"16":2.222013299,"17":3.662456955,"18":0.494701904,"19":1.20398552,"20":9.2,"21":0.63504714,"22":252.3528777,"23":57.9,"24":308.8,"25":1.7,"26":0.067574896,"27":61.0,"28":30.0,"29":15.0,"30":12.0,"31":6.0,"32":3.0,"33":11.0,"34":5.0,"35":0.109656065,"36":0.076759246,"37":0.259290861,"38":0.008848602,"39":5.333333333333334,"40":19.38821423,"62":1.271560416,"63":0.028003863,"64":42.29298478,"65":6.505793396,"66":0.619871591,"68":7.1,"69":3.12278083,"70":0.285140932,"72":3.407921762,"73":12.5950639,"210":16.0}},{"appliedStats":{"4":8.0,"20":-2.0,"8":16.0,"72":-2.0,"24":4.6000000000000005},"appliedTotal":24.6,"externalId":"401127863","id":"01401127863","proTeamId":9,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"0":53.0,"64":1.0,"1":34.0,"65":1.0,"2":19.0,"3":422.0,"68":1.0,"4":2.0,"69":1.0,"5":84.0,"6":42.0,"7":21.0,"72":1.0,"8":16.0,"9":8.0,"73":2.0,"10":4.0,"11":6.0,"12":3.0,"13":3.0,"14":1.0,"210":1.0,"18":1.0,"20":1.0,"21":64.151,"22":422.0,"23":5.0,"24":46.0,"27":9.0,"28":4.0,"156":1.0,"29":2.0,"30":1.0,"33":1.0,"39":9.2,"40":46.0,"176":2.0}},{"appliedAverage":19.9667062576,"appliedStats":{"19":2.83989528,"4":120.57642928,"20":-13.044970488,"8":160.0,"72":-7.062440412,"24":25.80541935,"25":10.082584374,"26":0.129689542,"63":0.17398693799999998},"appliedTotal":299.500593864,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":550.7776761,"1":341.2657704,"2":209.5119057,"3":4002.655807,"4":30.14410732,"5":800.0,"6":400.0,"7":200.0,"8":160.0,"9":80.0,"10":40.0,"11":68.0,"12":34.0,"15":3.380785124,"16":2.209343079,"17":3.651959019,"18":0.493283908,"19":1.41994764,"20":6.522485244,"21":0.619607121,"22":254.9462297,"23":45.61866827,"24":258.0541935,"25":1.680430729,"26":0.064844771,"27":51.0,"28":25.0,"29":12.0,"30":10.0,"31":5.0,"33":9.0,"34":4.0,"35":0.085866757,"36":0.06010673,"37":0.180903331,"38":0.006173537,"39":5.656767356,"40":16.43657283,"62":1.484792411,"63":0.028997823,"64":44.82880355,"65":6.853646776,"66":0.524934247,"68":7.378581023,"69":3.289750453,"70":0.241469754,"72":3.531220206,"73":10.05370545,"210":15.7}},{"appliedStats":{"19":0.18358936,"4":7.330841896,"20":-0.69129562,"8":10.0,"72":-0.42353762,"24":1.1403183940000001,"25":0.523974348,"26":0.005992122,"63":0.01042791},"appliedTotal":18.080310790000002,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"0":35.18255915,"1":21.86806242,"2":13.31449673,"3":253.4783726,"4":1.832710474,"5":50.0,"6":25.0,"7":12.0,"8":10.0,"9":5.0,"10":2.0,"11":4.0,"12":2.0,"15":0.215905475,"16":0.141094228,"17":0.235117561,"18":0.031758218,"19":0.09179468,"20":0.34564781,"21":0.621559743,"22":253.4783726,"23":2.267636888,"24":11.40318394,"25":0.087329058,"26":0.002996061,"27":2.0,"28":1.0,"35":0.004245853,"36":0.002972097,"37":0.005619919,"38":1.92E-4,"39":5.028663983,"40":11.40318394,"62":0.094790741,"63":0.001737985,"64":2.326701368,"65":0.417024137,"66":0.025211356,"68":0.442235493,"69":0.200171586,"70":0.011597224,"72":0.21176881,"73":0.55741662,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"19":0.179603714,"4":7.507500704,"20":-0.511435112,"8":9.0,"72":-0.424989924,"24":1.42217814,"25":0.532807314,"26":0.006647346,"63":0.01046823},"appliedTotal":17.722780412,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"0":32.11067314,"1":20.02965807,"2":12.08101508,"3":228.5898716,"4":1.876875176,"5":45.0,"6":22.0,"7":11.0,"8":9.0,"9":4.0,"10":2.0,"11":4.0,"12":2.0,"15":0.17841332,"16":0.116593104,"17":0.160364485,"18":0.021661037,"19":0.089801857,"20":0.255717556,"21":0.623769486,"22":228.5898716,"23":2.513850071,"24":14.2217814,"25":0.088801219,"26":0.003323673,"27":2.0,"28":1.0,"35":0.004717354,"36":0.003302148,"37":0.008767495,"38":2.99201E-4,"39":5.657370566,"40":14.2217814,"62":0.09312553,"63":0.001744705,"64":2.651006754,"65":0.414005785,"66":0.029939533,"68":0.443945319,"69":0.198722777,"70":0.013772185,"72":0.212494962,"73":0.468212518,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"4":4.0,"8":9.0,"24":-0.1},"appliedTotal":12.9,"externalId":"401127925","id":"01401127925","proTeamId":9,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"0":29.0,"1":17.0,"2":12.0,"3":235.0,"4":1.0,"5":47.0,"6":23.0,"7":11.0,"8":9.0,"9":4.0,"10":2.0,"11":3.0,"12":1.0,"13":2.0,"14":1.0,"15":1.

and Nick Chubb set to consume huge workloads, Landry is no longer the Browns' top option and was more of a WR3 during the second half of last season under offensive coordinator Freddie Kitchens. But there is still potential for him to shine as a possession weapon this week against a Titans defense that struggled to contain receivers in 2018.","2":"While the target volume wasn't great in Week 1, Landry's average target travelled more than 13 yards against the Titans, resulting in nearly 17 yards per catch. The Jets have allowed 3,400 to receivers since the start of last season. If that seems like a lot, it is. Only the Saints have surrendered more yards over that span. No longer the high-floor target hog of years past, Landry is still a solid WR3 given this uptick in verticality combined with a sweet Week 2 matchup.","3":"Leading the Browns in routes and second in targets, Landry's advanced usage rates look better than his surface production. This could mean he's due for some positive regression and remains in the flex tier for this meeting with the Rams.","4":"Landry had a nice jump in usage for Week 3, when he tied Odell Beckham for the Cleveland's lead in targets. He also more than doubled his former college teammate in air yardage in the loss to the Rams.

has finished as a top 20 fantasy receiver each of the past four seasons, but he hit his lowest mark during that span last season (18th) and that was before Cleveland's trade for Odell Beckham Jr. Landry has handled a target share of at least 27 percent during each of the past four seasons, but he's unlikely to come close to that mark in 2019. The 2014 second-round pick enjoyed a 32 percent share during Weeks 1-8 last season, but plummeted to 21 percent once Freddie Kitchens took over the offense; he was 28th at the position in fantasy points during Kitchens' eight games. Landry's catch rate plummeted to 55 percent in 2018 after clearing 67 percent in all four seasons in Miami. There's enough volume to allow Landry WR3 production, but he's now second fiddle to Beckham.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":10.283895491062502,"appliedStats":{"53":44.679989765,"102":0.10592726400000001,"72":-1.41608526,"24":1.02947557,"25":0.24749401799999998,"26":0.001982514,"42":89.31618433,"43":30.17123463,"44":0.376200578,"63":0.029924448},"appliedTotal":164.54232785700003,"externalId":"2018","id":"102018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":1.891993373,"24":10.2947557,"25":0.041249003,"26":9.91257E-4,"27":2.0,"28":1.0,"35":0.003473541,"36":0.002431478,"37":2.15304E-4,"38":7.35E-6,"39":5.441221859924559,"40":0.643422231,"41":89.35997953,"42":893.1618433,"43":5.028539105,"44":0.188100289,"45":0.096249809,"46":0.06289925,"47":178.0,"48":89.0,"49":44.0,"50":35.0,"51":17.0,"52":8.0,"53":89.35997953,"54":17.0,"55":8.0,"56":2.068952403,"57":0.063988219,"58":128.6419234,"60":9.99509901409665,"61":55.82261521,"62":0.189091546,"63":0.004987408,"66":0.026312352,"67":1.242748122,"68":1.269060473,"70":0.012103682,"71":0.695938948,"72":0.70804263,"73":0.70804263,"102":0.017654544,"115":14.43978333,"210":16.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":4.0,"42":16.7},"appliedTotal":20.7,"externalId":"401128018","id":"01401128018","proTeamId":5,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"41":8.0,"42":167.0,"47":33.0,"48":16.0,"49":8.0,"210":1.0,"50":6.0,"51":3.0,"52":1.0,"53":8.0,"54":1.0,"56":1.0,"58":10.0,"59":124.0,"155":1.0,"60":20.875,"61":167.0}},{"appliedAverage":9.704915224312499,"appliedStats":{"53":34.64521742,"102":0.049412046,"72":-0.89242199,"24":2.706320851,"25":1.3266516300000002,"26":0.02524366,"42":82.68166087,"43":34.03069284,"44":0.686893992,"63":0.01897227},"appliedTotal":155.27864358899998,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":3.970153095,"24":27.06320851,"25":0.221108605,"26":0.01262183,"27":5.0,"28":2.0,"29":1.0,"30":1.0,"35":0.007297653,"36":0.005108357,"37":0.001817503,"38":6.20244E-5,"39":6.816666225,"40":1.691450532,"42":826.8166087,"43":5.67178214,"44":0.343446996,"45":0.119536239,"46":0.078116932,"47":165.0,"48":82.0,"49":41.0,"50":33.0,"51":16.0,"53":69.29043484,"54":13.0,"55":6.0,"56":1.688423727,"57":0.052219291,"58":113.2563985,"60":11.9326226,"61":51.67603804,"62":0.356068827,"63":0.003162045,"66":0.043602592,"67":0.760988934,"68":0.804591526,"70":0.020057192,"71":0.426153803,"72":0.446210995,"73":0.446210995,"102":0.008235341,"115":6.729235294,"210":16.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":2.4122666545,"102":0.11569860000000001,"72":-0.05964428,"24":0.1303439632,"25":0.040783566,"26":8.85436E-4,"42":5.858367961,"43":1.62219561,"44":0.032125324,"63":0.001266},"appliedTotal":10.154288834699999,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":0.211254651,"24":1.303439632,"25":0.006797261,"26":4.42718E-4,"35":3.88178E-4,"36":2.71725E-4,"37":6.48899E-5,"38":2.21444E-6,"39":6.169992592,"40":1.303439632,"42":58.58367961,"43":0.270365935,"44":0.016062662,"45":0.008434857,"46":0.005512179,"47":11.0,"48":5.0,"49":2.0,"50":2.0,"51":1.0,"53":4.824533309,"56":0.146171923,"57":0.004520781,"58":7.790738386,"60":12.14286976,"61":58.58367961,"62":0.01650538,"63":2.11E-4,"66":0.002250895,"67":0.051404871,"68":0.053655766,"70":0.001035412,"71":0.028786728,"72":0.02982214,"73":0.02982214,"102":0.0192831,"115":16.24959375,"118":1.0,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":2.3239872515,"102":0.012855402000000002,"72":-0.05774526,"24":0.1380524538,"25":0.050676479999999996,"26":9.42884E-4,"42":5.405409508000001,"43":1.582867452,"44":0.032768036,"63":0.0012256440000000001},"appliedTotal":9.491039851300002,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":0.220179612,"24":1.380524538,"25":0.00844608,"26":4.71442E-4,"35":4.04611E-4,"36":2.83228E-4,"37":7.33958E-5,"38":2.50472E-6,"39":6.269992592,"40":1.380524538,"42":54.05409508,"43":0.263811242,"44":0.016384018,"45":0.008323137,"46":0.00543917,"47":10.0,"48":5.0,"49":2.0,"50":2.0,"51":1.0,"53":4.647974503,"56":0.118605958,"57":0.003668226,"58":7.210915531,"60":11.62960232,"61":54.05409508,"62":0.01685546,"63":2.04274E-4,"66":0.002350893,"67":0.049627176,"68":0.051978069,"70":0.001081411,"71":0.027791219,"72":0.02887263,"73":0.02887263,"102":0.002142567,"115":1.805510417,"210":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":9.278176109153847,"appliedStats":{"53":27.756091025,"102":0.419506344,"72":-0.693423646,"24":1.9857340700000004,"25":0.6482080379999999,"26":0.013386738,"42":67.45154472,"43":22.573586118,"44":0.446915218,"63":0.014740794},"appliedTotal":120.61628941900001,"externalId":"2019","id":"122019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{"23":3.159430626,"24":19.8573407,"25":0.108034673,"26":0.006693369,"27":3.0,"28":1.0,"35":0.005807237,"36":0.004065066,"37":0.001199053

young Kenny Golladay on the team, it can be easy to forget about Jones. The veteran wideout was limited due to injuries last season but had his best year as a pro in 2017. He was dealing with an undisclosed injury at some point this preseason, but if there are no red flags about his health leading up to kickoff, you can trust him as a WR3/flex option against a Cardinals defense that isn't weak against the pass.","2":"Jones failed to make an impact for the Lions as Matthew Stafford looked to rookie TE T.J. Hockenson and veteran slot man Danny Amendola on 22 of his 45 attempts. Jones only saw four targets, but caught them all, and that figures to be an outlier for the talented wideout. Week 2's matchup with the Chargers doesn't seem appealing based on last year's stats (Los Angeles allowed the fifth-fewest points to wide receivers), but they did allow T.Y. Hilton to score twice in Week 1. With that in mind, Jones remains in the mix as a WR3/flex option in Week 2. ","3":"Jones has spent most of his career serving as a very good secondary option in passing games, in the past complementing the likes of A.J. Green and Golden Tate. Currently, he serves as second in line behind Kenny Golladay. In other words, he might not be Detroit's top receiver, but that's been his role for a while and it's suited him well. Week 2 saw the Eagles allow big numbers to both the primary and secondary receivers of the Falcons (Julio Jones and Calvin Ridley), so there's reason to expect more of the same in Week 3. As such, Jones is in the conversation as a flex pick for the week ahead.","4":"Jones might be No. 2 on the Lions' WR depth chart (behind Kenny Golladay) from a fantasy perspective, but it's not a huge gap. The veteran has more catches and yards this season, while Golladay has more targets and touchdowns. Still, both have posted respectable scores through three weeks. They'll both be needed in Week 4 as the Lions host the high-scoring Chiefs. That means Jones is a high-end WR3/flex pick in almost every league."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":1.5603715170278638,"averageDraftPosition":122.18711451908652,"percentChange":5.299935369402036,"percentOwned":84.22792892600113,"percentStarted":34.2717165014368},"proTeamId":8,"rankings":{"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":26,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":28,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":29,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":28,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":31,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":29,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":33,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":28,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":31,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":32,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":28.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":30.333333333333332,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":35,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":36,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":35,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":36,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":39,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":37,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":46,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":36,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":36,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":38,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":36.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":39.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":41,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":37,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":39,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":37,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":38,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":44,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":38,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":49,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":44,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":32,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":41.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":39.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":22,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":22,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":22,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":45,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":23,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":21,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":24,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":45,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":23,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":45,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":22,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":20.75,"published":true,"r

after suffering an Achilles injury last December, it's worth mentioning Sanders cruised to 94 yards on a season-best 24 yards per catch in his lone meeting with the Raiders' soft secondary in 2018. It's probably not wise to get too excited about a Joe Flacco-led passing offense, but Sanders is undeniably in a good spot to return value as a WR3 in Oakland on Monday.","2":"After a remarkable recover from an Achilles injury, Sanders led the Broncos in routes and finished second on the team in targets and yardage in Week 1. It's clear Sanders will play an integral role as a play-making threat for Joe Flacco. The Bears present a brutal matchup for Denver's offense, but Sanders is a worthy flex thanks to his strong market share and long-standing pattern of efficiency.","3":"Dominating the target market once again for Denver so quickly after a major Achilles injury, Sanders is again posting WR1 usage and production with yet another quarterback. The Packers have a talented secondary but have struggled to contain big plays this year, allowing receivers to gain 18.5 yards per catch. With some positive metrics in his favor, Sanders is a fine WR2 heading into Week 3.","4":"The Packers rolled coverage to Sanders throughout Week 3 in an effort to suppress the Broncos' top receiving threat. The plan worked, leaving Sanders with a weak line. This week, the Jaguars have two capable cover corners to work against him. But with a good deal of work from the slot and a nice share of the passing offense at home, Sanders is firmly in the flex tier for Week

has finished four of his five seasons in Denver as a top-25 fantasy receiver, but he also has been limited to 12 games each of the past two seasons due to injury. Sanders was terrific in 2018, catching 74 percent of his targets (seventh best) and posting a 9.0 YPT (his highest since 2014). Sanders was fantasy's No. 14 scoring wideout prior to a Week 13 torn Achilles and finished 33 percent of his outings as a top-10 fantasy receiver (10th best).

quietly catching 71 passes in 2018, but he scored just four times and didn't provide much yardage for that type of workload (660). He's no more than a borderline fantasy start most weeks, as will be the case against the Vikings. ","2":"Hooper brought in all nine of his Week 1 targets, which is a fine start toward notching a bigger role in an offense that suddenly has plenty of questions on the ground. The passing game hasn't been in question, so Hooper looks to be a solid Week 2 play, as well. The Eagles let Washington TE Vernon Davis score on a catch-and-run as part of Case Keenum's career passing day. Matt Ryan should do well, and Hooper should benefit as a low-end fantasy TE1.","3":"Hooper took a statistical step back versus the Eagles in Week 2, despite seeing six targets. Most weeks, he'll be stuck as the third or fourth option behind Julio Jones and Calvin Ridley, which limits his fantasy ceiling. Among tight ends, however, he's still a top-15 type most of the time.

statistical producer returns to his original organization, which adds him to a crowded pass-catching picture. Jackson will probably be on the fantasy starter radar most weeks, especially in Week 1 against one of his other old clubs, the Redskins. Jackson typically plays better for fantasy potential in non-PPR games that focus on yardage and touchdowns and -- be prepared to repeat this most weeks of the season -- in those cases, he could fly as a boom-or-bust WR3. He should be over a finger injury, but keep an eye on his practice status.","2":"Jackson enjoyed a revenge game against Washington, going 8-154-2 on 10 targets in Week 1. In his latest stint with the Eagles, he's again benefitting from the duo of WR Alshon Jeffery and TE Zach Ertz taking attention away from defensive backfields. Jackson's \"boom or bust\" makeup keeps him as a risky flex option most weeks, but the Falcons matchup keeps him there and maybe even ticks him up to having possible WR3 fantasy upside in Week 2.","3":"Jackson is questionable for Week 3 with a groin injury. If he can gut through his setback and Alshon Jeffery (calf) and/or TE Dallas Goedert (calf) miss Week 3, Jackson could be in a better positon to perform for fantasy shareholders. The Lions have been poor while defending wideouts so far, so Jackson could be in for a big day, depending on who else suits up. An active Jackson would be a WR3/flex fantasy start, though you need to watch his status right up until kickoff.","4":"After missing Week 3, Jackson remains doubtful with a groin injury ahead of Philadelphia's Week 4's Thursday night matchup at the Packers.

His 17.4 YPR and 10.0 YPT are tops in the NFL since he entered the league in 2008.

non-PPR.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":9.695016668,"appliedStats":{"53":21.80931393,"102":0.460368,"72":-0.32871085,"24":2.386844284,"25":0.405209508,"26":0.009367904,"42":70.905908,"43":20.299261638,"44":0.385615202,"63":0.0070224},"appliedTotal":116.34020001599998,"externalId":"2018","id":"102018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":3.856336917,"24":23.86844284,"25":0.067534918,"26":0.004683952,"27":4.0,"28":2.0,"29":1.0,"35":0.007087957,"36":0.00496157,"37":0.00138969,"38":4.74248E-5,"39":6.189408071369507,"40":1.584626911,"41":43.61862786,"42":709.05908,"43":3.383210273,"44":0.192807601,"45":0.358191563,"46":0.234078186,"47":141.0,"48":70.0,"49":35.0,"50":28.0,"51":14.0,"52":7.0,"53":43.61862786,"54":8.0,"55":4.0,"56":1.110502309,"57":0.034345432,"58":73.75711046,"60":16.255877701513743,"61":47.07446174,"62":0.197491552,"63":0.0011704,"66":0.024190897,"67":0.273620736,"68":0.297811633,"70":0.011127813,"71":0.153227612,"72":0.164355425,"73":0.164355425,"102":0.076728,"115":56.9066,"210":12.0}},{"appliedStats":{},"appliedTotal":0.0,"externalId":"401127863","id":"01401127863","proTeamId":21,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{}},{"appliedAverage":8.4215470648,"appliedStats":{"53":21.69301506,"102":0.517914,"72":-0.38450693,"24":2.5719393740000003,"25":1.20176874,"26":0.027705872,"42":73.02505761,"43":27.033387024,"44":0.628700104,"63":0.008225118},"appliedTotal":126.32320597200001,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":4.20846318,"24":25.71939374,"25":0.20029479,"26":0.013852936,"27":5.0,"28":2.0,"29":1.0,"30":1.0,"35":0.007736774,"36":0.005415742,"37":0.001635683,"38":5.58196E-5,"39":6.111350542,"40":1.707511617,"42":730.2505761,"43":4.505564504,"44":0.314350052,"45":0.358223556,"46":0.234099094,"47":146.0,"48":73.0,"49":36.0,"50":29.0,"51":14.0,"53":43.38603012,"54":8.0,"55":4.0,"56":1.20649949,"57":0.037314417,"58":75.95401482,"60":16.83146797,"61":48.48136605,"62":0.328202989,"63":0.001370853,"66":0.030843606,"67":0.31797394,"68":0.348817546,"70":0.014188059,"71":0.178065406,"72":0.192253465,"73":0.192253465,"102":0.086319,"115":85.3599,"118":8.0,"119":3.0,"210":15.0625}},{"appliedStats":{},"appliedTotal":0.0,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{}},{"appliedStats":{},"appliedTotal":0.0,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{}},{"appliedStats":{},"appliedTotal":0.0,"externalId":"401127959","id":"01401127959","proTeamId":21,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{}},{"appliedAverage":9.113445841166667,"appliedStats":{"53":20.05824088,"72":-0.350728764,"24":1.9624620640000001,"25":0.95392509,"26":0.018755048,"42":64.90242365,"43":21.274977858,"44":0.533812064,"63":0.007482203999999999},"appliedTotal":109.361350094,"externalId":"2019","id":"122019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{"23":3.179141802,"24":19.62462064,"25":0.158987515,"26":0.009377524,"27":3.0,"28":1.0,"35":0.005844612,"36":0.004091229,"37":0.001272313,"38":4.34192E-5,"39":6.172930264,"40":1.635385053,"42":649.0242365,"43":3.545829643,"44":0.266906032,"45":0.238639571,"46":0.15595096,"47":129.0,"48":64.0,"49":32.0,"50":25.0,"51":12.0,"53":40.11648176,"54":8.0,"55":4.0,"56":1.428353614,"57":0.044175885,"58":69.7466278,"60":16.17849343,"61":54.08535304,"62":0.276283556,"63":0.001247034,"66":0.023299764,"67":0.294011591,"68":0.317311355,"70":0.010717891,"71":0.164646491,"72":0.175364382,"73":0.175364382,"210":12.0}},{"appliedAverage":10.9,"appliedStats":{"53":20.5,"24":2.9000000000000004,"25":6.0,"42":77.4,"43":24.0},"appliedTotal":130.8,"externalId":"2018","id":"002018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":6.0,"24":29.0,"25":1.0,"27":3.0,"39":4.833333333333333,"40":1.8125,"41":41.0,"42":774.0,"43":4.0,"45":3.0,"46":3.0,"47":149.0,"48":70.0,"49":32.0,"50":25.0,"51":9.0,"52":3.0,"53":41.0,"54":3.0,"56":3.0,"58":74.0,"59":44.0,"60":18.878048780487806,"61":48.375,"108":3.0,"109":3.0,"115":24.0,"118":1.0,"155":5.0,"156":11.0,"174":0.3125,"210":12.0}},{"appliedAverage":15.7,"appliedStats":{"53":4.0,"42":15.4,"43":12.0},"appliedTotal":31.4,"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"41":8.0,"42":154.0,"43":2.0,"45":2.0,"46":2.0,"47":30.0,"48":15.0,"49":7.0,"50":6.0,"210":2.0,"51":3.0,"52":1.0,"53":8.0,"54":1.0,"56":1.0,"58":9.0,"59":13.0,"155":1.0,"60":19.25,"156":1.0,"61":77.0,"158":12.0}}],"universeId":2},"ratings":{"0":{"positionalRanking":42,"totalRanking":111,"totalRating":31.4}},"rosterLocked":true,"status":"O

to stream Brady in lineups. Welcome to 2019, where streaming Tom Brady is an entirely realistic and viable plan. The Steelers produced an elite sack rate last season but also struggled against big plays in the passing phase, setting up Brady with one of the more bankable projections at the position this week.","2":"Brady posted his 48th career game with at least 300 passing yards and three passing scores this past Sunday night. The Patriots are 44-4 in such games. The Dolphins saw Lamar Jackson post five scores with Baltimore tallying 59 points in Week 1, setting up Brady with an ideal road matchup against a feeble division foe.","3":"Brady finally accomplished the goal he set for himself when he drafted in the sixth round all those years ago -- he compiled his 20th career rushing touchdown this past week and became the 13th different Patriots player to do so. We hear Brady is also a good passer, something that could surface facing an exploitable Jets secondary at home on Sunday.","4":"Brady is now just two touchdown passes from Drew Brees for the second-most passing scores ever and just 15 away from Peyton Manning's record. The Bills present the Patriots' first real defensive challenge this season, as Buffalo has allowed the fewest yards per dropback to passers since the start of last season. Then again, Brady has thrived against the Bills in his career and remains in a good spot to deliver fantasy value given an offense dependent on his quick-hitting accuracy."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":5.131578947368421,"averageDraftPosition":60.500708274310476,"percentChange":-0.2059463795594212,"percentOwned":97.22788905558146,"percentStarted":59.25735246338853},"proTeamId":17,"rankings":{"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":14.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":14.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":17,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":3.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":3.1666666666666665,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":3.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":4.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":12.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":12.166666666666666,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}]},"seasonOutlook":"Brady has finished no worse than 11th in pass attempts, completions, passing yards and passing touchdowns during nine of the past 10 seasons (the only exception being the 2016 suspension-shortened season). Despite consistently ranking near the top of the league in these key categories, Brady has posted only two fantasy campaigns better than ninth during the past six campaigns. Limited by a switch to a run-heavy scheme, Brady was held to five top-10 fantasy weeks last season (his fewest in the past decade). Adding concern is the retirement of Rob Gronkowski, as the New England offense saw a large dip in touchdowns, passing yards, completion percentage and yards per attempt during the 29 games Gronkowski missed from 2010 to 2018. Brady is still an elite player, but New England's run-first offense limits him to QB2

second-year talent was the talk of training camp thanks to developing a big-play rapport with Lamar Jackson. But his success in real games could be stunted if Baltimore continues a committee approach to the position with Andrews, Hayden Hurst and Nick Boyle. But if you are committed to starting a one tight end against Miami’s suspect defense, Andrews is the best option.","2":"Andrews was brilliant in the Ravens' opener with eight catches on eight targets, including a late touchdown from Robert Griffin III. Lamar Jackson peppered Andrews, who was targeted on a team-high 35% of the starting quarterback's attempts. With a blend of usage, chemistry and a positive matchup, Andrews is a viable Week 2 starting option against the Cardinals, who just allowed Detroit's top rookie tight end to top 100 yards.","3":"Through the first two weeks, Andrews is top tight end in fantasy football. He has secured an absurd 88% of his targets and amassed an amazing 12 first downs. Andrews consistently flashed his ability during Ravens practices prior to the season, and the hype is being realized. The Chiefs have surrendered the fifth-most yards to tight ends this season, helping Andrews' case as a locked-in TE1 option for Week 3.","4":"Second on the team with a target-per-route rate of 33.8%, Andrews is enjoying receiver-like usage during this early-seaosn breakout. The tight end, who was hampered by an injury in Week 3, was still second on the Ravens in targets despite 15 yards receiving against the Chiefs.

was the second tight end drafted by Baltimore last season, but that didn't stop the Oklahoma product from producing one of the best seasons by a rookie tight end over the past decade. Andrews' 552 receiving yards rank sixth, and his 16.2 YPR, 10.0 YPT and 10.4 aDOT all rank second among rookie tight ends since 2007. Andrews did all that damage despite playing only 35 percent of the snaps. Andrews' future looks bright, but he'll need to find ways to stay on the field with 2018 first-round pick Hayden Hurst and re-signed blocker Nick Boyle also on the roster. Andrews is a fine late-round flier, but Baltimore's run-heavy offense will limit his upside.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":2.87735249425,"appliedStats":{"53":11.71325255,"72":-0.311091764,"42":24.76585137,"43":9.712927086,"44":0.150151072,"63":0.006549594},"appliedTotal":46.037639908,"externalId":"2018","id":"102018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"41":23.4265051,"42":247.6585137,"43":1.618821181,"44":0.075075536,"45":0.096674521,"46":0.063176799,"47":49.0,"48":24.0,"49":12.0,"50":9.0,"51":4.0,"52":2.0,"53":23.4265051,"54":4.0,"55":2.0,"56":0.099475812,"57":0.003076572,"58":35.69125286,"60":10.571722612606008,"61":15.4786571,"62":0.075075536,"63":0.001091599,"67":0.277760503,"68":0.277760503,"71":0.155545882,"72":0.155545882,"73":0.155545882,"210":16.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":2.0,"42":3.1,"43":6.0},"appliedTotal":11.1,"externalId":"401128018","id":"01401128018","proTeamId":33,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"41":4.0,"42":31.0,"43":1.0,"47":6.0,"48":3.0,"49":1.0,"210":1.0,"50":1.0,"53":4.0,"183":1.0,"58":8.0,"59":5.0,"60":7.75,"156":1.0,"61":31.0,"158":6.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":1.5,"42":1.5},"appliedTotal":3.0,"externalId":"401127953","id":"01401127953","proTeamId":33,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"41":3.0,"42":15.0,"47":3.0,"48":1.0,"53":3.0,"58":7.0,"60":5.0,"61":15.0,"156":1.0,"210":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":6.92550047625,"appliedStats":{"53":24.15094914,"72":-0.641424004,"42":65.12555408,"43":21.608033634,"44":0.551390504,"63":0.013504266},"appliedTotal":110.80800762,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"42":651.2555408,"43":3.601338939,"44":0.275695252,"45":0.242609019,"46":0.158544994,"47":130.0,"48":65.0,"49":32.0,"50":26.0,"51":13.0,"53":48.30189828,"54":9.0,"55":4.0,"56":0.883034208,"57":0.027310336,"58":75.07124443,"60":13.48302166,"61":40.7034713,"62":0.275695252,"63":0.002250711,"67":0.572700004,"68":0.572700004,"71":0.320712002,"72":0.320712002,"73":0.320712002,"210":16.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":2.113839381,"72":-0.06182381,"42":5.786920522,"43":2.180201736,"44":0.04866016,"63":0.00130161},"appliedTotal":10.069099599000001,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"42":57.86920522,"43":0.363366956,"44":0.02433008,"45":0.017117748,"46":0.011186448,"47":11.0,"48":5.0,"49":2.0,"50":2.0,"51":1.0,"53":4.227678762,"56":0.141648149,"57":0.004380871,"58":6.459610439,"60":13.68817464,"61":57.86920522,"62":0.02433008,"63":2.16935E-4,"67":0.05519983,"68":0.05519983,"71":0.030911905,"72":0.030911905,"73":0.030911905,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":2.1926918365,"72":-0.065122938,"42":6.132876503,"43":2.222611158,"44":0.047882998,"63":0.001371072},"appliedTotal":10.532310629500001,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"42":61.32876503,"43":0.370435193,"44":0.023941499,"45":0.01975691,"46":0.01291114,"47":12.0,"48":6.0,"49":3.0,"50":2.0,"51":1.0,"53":4.385383673,"56":0.164113347,"57":0.005075671,"58":6.590311863,"60":13.98481173,"61":61.32876503,"62":0.023941499,"63":2.28512E-4,"67":0.05814548,"68":0.05814548,"71":0.032561469,"72":0.032561469,"73":0.032561469,"210":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":10.355803887307694,"appliedStats":{"53":28.368094365,"72":-0.829686338,"42":77.54474879000001,"43":28.890434220000003,"44":0.634391638,"63":0.017467859999999998},"appliedTotal":134.62545053500003,"externalId":"2019","id":"122019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{"42":775.4474879,"43":4.81507237,"44":0.317195819,"45":0.222068968,"46":0.145122071,"47":155.0,"48":77.0,"49":38.0,"50":31.0,"51":15.0,"53":56.73618873,"54":11.0,"55":5.0,"56":1.995577621,"57":0.061718896,"58":86.6890938,"60":13.6675992,"61":59.64980676,"62":0.317195819,"63":0.00291131,"67":0.740791374,"68":0.740791374,"71":0.414843169,"72":0.414843169,"73":0.414843169,"210":13.0}},{"appliedAverage":5.6375,"appliedStats":{"53":17.0,"42":55.2,"43":18.0},"appliedTotal":90.2,"externalId":"2018","id":"002018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"41":34.0,"42":552.0,"43":3.0,"45":1.0,"46":1.0,"47":104.0,"48":49.0,"49":19.0,"50":15.0,"51":5.0,"53":34.0,"58":51.0,"59":64.0,"60":16.235294117647058,"61":34.5,"108":1.0,"109":1.0,"155":10.0,"156":6.0,"174":0.625,"210":16.0}},{"appliedAverage":15.0,"appliedStats":{"53":9.5,"42":23.5,"43":12.0},"appliedTotal":45.0,"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"67":1.0,"68":1.0,"41":19.0,"42":235.0,"43":2.0,"47":46.0,"48":22.0,"49":10.0,"210":3.0,"50":8.0,"51":4.0,"52":2.0,"53":19.0,"54":2.0,"183":1.0,"56":2.0,"185":1.0,"58":24.0,"59":71.0,"155":2.0,"60":12.36842105,"156":1.0,

This is an average group on paper, but it is led by a coach who always maximizes his talent. As usual, the Patriots' D/ST is a back-end starting option.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":6.708451489874999,"appliedStats":{"96":11.589267252,"97":3.075715404,"98":0.638823638,"99":43.13236367,"101":2.548103736,"102":2.3674596180000003,"103":8.893042326,"104":4.876784748,"93":0.8158215059999999,"95":29.39784194},"appliedTotal":107.33522383799999,"externalId":"2018","id":"102018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"93":0.135970251,"94":2.294971179,"95":14.69892097,"96":5.794633626,"97":1.537857702,"98":0.319411819,"99":43.13236367,"100":86.0,"101":0.424683956,"102":0.394576603,"103":1.482173721,"104":0.812797458,"105":3.25020199,"106":8.914820962,"112":37.34909559,"113":72.71115411,"114":938.5050664,"115":325.6740955,"120":318.2087567,"121":16.0,"126":19.88804729,"127":5553.584479,"131":16.0,"137":347.09903,"160":-318.2087567,"210":16.0}},{"appliedAverage":5.799536309124999,"appliedStats":{"96":15.025549856,"97":1.3892736,"98":0.545578462,"99":37.41074891,"132":-10.0,"101":1.18908,"102":1.9247653859999998,"103":8.25901296,"104":4.71053616,"123":-1.0,"92":2.0,"93":0.772182312,"95":30.5658533},"appliedTotal":92.79258094599999,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"92":2.0,"93":0.128697052,"94":2.16159152,"95":15.28292665,"96":7.512774928,"97":0.6946368,"98":0.272789231,"99":37.41074891,"100":74.82149782,"101":0.19818,"102":0.320794231,"103":1.37650216,"104":0.78508936,"105":2.809262803,"106":11.55811527,"109":871.470849,"110":290.0,"111":174.0,"113":68.37242231,"114":743.175,"115":305.8309526,"116":74.0,"117":29.0,"118":30.0,"119":12.0,"120":328.1145853,"121":7.0,"122":6.0,"123":1.0,"126":20.50716158,"127":5716.916103,"131":6.0,"132":10.0,"137":357.3072564,"160":-328.1145853,"210":16.0}},{"appliedStats":{"128":0.0,"97":2.0,"129":0.0,"130":0.0,"99":5.0,"132":-1.0,"133":0.0,"134":0.0,"135":0.0,"136":0.0,"89":0.0,"90":0.0,"123":0.0,"91":3.0,"92":0.0,"124":0.0,"93":6.0,"95":8.0},"appliedTotal":23.0,"externalId":"401127866","id":"01401127866","proTeamId":17,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"192":0.0,"128":0.0,"193":0.0,"129":0.0,"194":0.0,"130":0.0,"195":0.0,"131":0.0,"132":1.0,"133":0.0,"134":0.0,"135":0.0,"136":0.0,"210":1.0,"89":0.0,"90":0.0,"155":1.0,"91":1.0,"92":0.0,"93":1.0,"95":4.0,"97":1.0,"99":5.0,"100":10.0,"105":1.0,"106":2.0,"107":11.0,"108":56.0,"109":67.0,"110":22.0,"111":13.0,"113":6.0,"114":43.0,"116":4.0,"117":1.0,"120":10.0,"121":0.0,"122":0.0,"187":10.0,"123":0.0,"124":0.0,"188":0.0,"189":0.0,"190":1.0,"191":0.0,"127":375.0}},{"appliedStats":{"96":0.809975598,"97":0.0842436,"98":0.030636814,"99":2.295580734,"101":0.07416,"102":0.10746,"103":0.54311796,"104":0.27290088,"93":0.049143780000000005,"95":2.691698634},"appliedTotal":6.958918000000001,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"93":0.00819063,"94":0.13600314,"95":1.345849317,"96":0.404987799,"97":0.0421218,"98":0.015318407,"99":2.295580734,"100":4.591161468,"101":0.01236,"102":0.01791,"103":0.09051966,"104":0.04548348,"105":0.17446377,"106":0.623058152,"109":55.625232,"110":18.0,"111":11.0,"113":5.689631474,"114":46.35,"115":17.512,"116":4.0,"117":1.0,"118":1.0,"120":20.4697561,"121":1.0,"126":20.4697561,"127":326.9366053,"131":1.0,"137":326.9366053,"160":-20.4697561,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"96":0.81011054,"97":0.0847912,"98":0.030648232,"99":2.711742502,"101":0.07416,"102":0.109518114,"103":0.54268104,"104":0.26633712,"91":3.0,"93":0.048793751999999996,"95":2.84044732},"appliedTotal":10.51922982,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"91":1.0,"93":0.008132292,"94":0.13483636,"95":1.42022366,"96":0.40505527,"97":0.0423956,"98":0.015324116,"99":2.711742502,"100":5.423485005,"101":0.01236,"102":0.018253019,"103":0.09044684,"104":0.04438952,"105":0.173581671,"106":0.623161954,"109":54.10501964,"110":18.0,"111":10.0,"113":5.251844003,"114":46.35,"115":17.75285155,"116":4.0,"117":1.0,"118":1.0,"120":11.36585653,"126":11.36585653,"127":324.0420178,"131":1.0,"137":324.0420178,"160":-11.36585653,"210":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":8.453921130615385,"appliedStats":{"96":12.461429692,"128":15.0,"97":1.346147876,"98":0.48679687,"130":2.0,"99":32.30376417,"132":-3.0,"133":-3.0,"101":0.9661275,"102":1.40268375,"103":8.62036743,"104":4.238349822,"123":-1.0,"91":3.0,"92":4.0,"93":0.7754519879999999,"95":30.2998556},"appliedTotal":109.900974698,"externalId":"2019","id":"122019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{"91":1.0,"92":4.0,"93":0.129241998,"94":2.143119542,"95":15.1499278,"96":6.230714846,"97":0.673073938,"98":0.243398435,"99":32.30376417,"100":64.60752835,"101":0.16102125,"102":0.233780625,"103":1.436727905,"104":0.706391637,"105":2.667163414,"106":9.585715147,"

in receptions (125) and yardage (1,405) while matching his career-best nine touchdowns in 2018. Though the Saints are a run-first offense now, Thomas remains a target hog. He'll continue that role in Week 1 against the Texans, planting him near the top of the WR rankings.","2":"Thomas put up another fantasy WR1 outing in the 2019 opener, catching 10-of-13 targets for 123 yards. Drew Brees' top target will remain a fantasy WR1 in Week 2 versus the Rams.","3":"A thumb injury caused Drew Brees to exit Week 2 and is expected to cost him 6-to-8 more weeks of action. That's bad news for Thomas, his typical No. 1 target, who was picked in the first round of many fantasy drafts. The offense looked sluggish with Teddy Bridgewater taking most of the snaps after Brees was hurt, but Thomas still caught 10 passes on the day. Given Brees' injury, fantasy managers should drop Thomas to mere fantasy WR2 territory. Even with the QB difficulties, that seems about right in Week 3 versus Seattle, whose secondary has some holes.","4":"Different quarterback, similar fantasy reliability. Thomas saw just seven targets but found the end zone for the first time this year in Week 3, with Teddy Bridgewater directing the offense instead of the injured Drew Brees (thumb). Going forward, Thomas may not be the \"target hog\" we are used to seeing, but he'll still have a high floor for looks, keeping him in the lower end of the fantasy WR1 tier in Week 4 against the

has been in the NFL for three seasons and has finished each of them as a top 7 fantasy wide receiver. Thomas has ranked top 7 at the position in targets, receptions and yardage during each of the past two seasons. He paced the league with 125 receptions last season thanks to an otherworldly 84 percent catch rate. Thanks, in part, to super-accurate Drew Brees, Thomas has posted a catch rate of at least 72 percent during each of his three NFL seasons. Thomas has yet to reach double-digit touchdowns and has never cleared seven end zone targets in a season, but his elite efficiency and hefty target volume in the Saints' high-scoring offense is plenty enough to allow top-end fantasy production. He's a solid first-round target.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":14.244489167375002,"appliedStats":{"53":50.2,"72":-0.90834879,"42":127.04000000000002,"43":51.0,"44":0.561051482,"63":0.019123986},"appliedTotal":227.91182667800004,"externalId":"2018","id":"102018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"41":100.4,"42":1270.4,"43":8.5,"44":0.280525741,"45":0.266403954,"46":0.174094984,"47":254.0,"48":127.0,"49":63.0,"50":50.0,"51":25.0,"52":12.0,"53":100.4,"54":20.0,"55":10.0,"56":4.735309654,"57":0.146452876,"58":143.0,"60":12.653386454183266,"61":79.40046043,"62":0.280525741,"63":0.003187331,"67":0.811025705,"68":0.8,"71":0.454174395,"72":0.454174395,"73":0.454174395,"210":16.0}},{"appliedAverage":14.728412679875,"appliedStats":{"53":56.70212405,"72":-1.458224948,"42":131.1628813,"43":48.338288490000004,"44":0.878833144,"63":0.030700842},"appliedTotal":235.654602878,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"42":1311.628813,"43":8.056381415,"44":0.439416572,"45":0.277691309,"46":0.18147127,"47":262.0,"48":131.0,"49":65.0,"50":52.0,"51":26.0,"53":113.4042481,"54":22.0,"55":11.0,"56":5.036918824,"57":0.155780995,"58":146.0409828,"60":11.56595838,"61":81.97680082,"62":0.439416572,"63":0.005116807,"67":1.301986562,"68":1.301986562,"71":0.729112474,"72":0.729112474,"73":0.729112474,"210":16.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":3.3457872875,"72":-0.078782638,"42":7.569962041,"43":2.8502120520000003,"44":0.050358508,"63":0.001656},"appliedTotal":13.7391932505,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"42":75.69962041,"43":0.475035342,"44":0.025179254,"45":0.011638901,"46":0.007606022,"47":15.0,"48":7.0,"49":3.0,"50":3.0,"51":1.0,"53":6.691574575,"54":1.0,"56":0.26819948,"57":0.008294829,"58":9.318136041,"60":11.31267679,"61":75.69962041,"62":0.025179254,"63":2.76E-4,"67":0.070341641,"68":0.070341641,"71":0.039391319,"72":0.039391319,"73":0.039391319,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":3.473434249,"72":-0.082121186,"42":7.971484437,"43":2.46697554,"44":0.042514064,"63":0.0017289419999999998},"appliedTotal":13.874016046,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"42":79.71484437,"43":0.41116259,"44":0.021257032,"45":0.012439826,"46":0.008129426,"47":15.0,"48":7.0,"49":3.0,"50":3.0,"51":1.0,"53":6.946868498,"54":1.0,"56":0.298385943,"57":0.009228431,"58":9.652450533,"60":11.47493211,"61":79.71484437,"62":0.021257032,"63":2.88157E-4,"67":0.073322488,"68":0.073322488,"71":0.041060593,"72":0.041060593,"73":0.041060593,"210":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":14.199725097923077,"appliedStats":{"53":44.341035065,"72":-1.044090196,"42":100.59055660000001,"43":39.992639843999996,"44":0.694303132,"63":0.021981828},"appliedTotal":184.596426273,"externalId":"2019","id":"122019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{"42":1005.905566,"43":6.665439974,"44":0.347151566,"45":0.172500992,"46":0.112729399,"47":201.0,"48":100.0,"49":50.0,"50":40.0,"51":20.0,"53":88.68207013,"54":17.0,"55":8.0,"56":3.649496092,"57":0.112871013,"58":120.0709537,"60":11.3428291,"61":77.3773512,"62":0.347151566,"63":0.003663638,"67":0.932223389,"68":0.932223389,"71":0.522045098,"72":0.522045098,"73":0.522045098,"210":13.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":4.5,"42":9.5},"appliedTotal":14.0,"externalId":"401128102","id":"01401128102","proTeamId":18,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"41":9.0,"42":95.0,"47":19.0,"48":9.0,"49":4.0,"210":1.0,"50":3.0,"51":1.0,"53":9.0,"54":1.0,"58":9.0,"59":26.0,"155":1.0,"60":10.556,"61":95.0}},{"appliedAverage":15.8125,"appliedStats":{"53":62.5,"72":-4.0,"42":140.5,"43":54.0},"appliedTotal":253.0,"externalId":"2018","id":"002018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"41":125.0,"42":1405.0,"43":9.0,"45":1.0,"46":1.0,"47":273.0,"48":132.0,"49":63.0,"50":47.0,"51":18.0,"52":5.0,"53":125.0,"54":19.0,"55":6.0,"56":3.0,"57":1.0,"58":147.0,"59":37.0,"60":11.24,"61":87.8125,"67":2.0,"68":2.0,"71":2.0,"72":2.0,"73":2.0,"108":1.0,"109":1.0,"155":13.0,"156":3.0,"174":0.8125,"210":16.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":2.5,"42":5.4,"43":6.0},"appliedTotal":13.9,"externalId":"401127993","id":"01401127993","proTeamId":18,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"41":5.0,"42":54.0,"43":1.0,"47":10.0,"48":5.0,"49":2.0,"50":2.0,"51":1.0,"53":5.0,"54":1.0,"58":7.0,"59":24.0,"60":10.8,"61":54.0,"155":1.0,"158":6.0,"183":1.0,"210":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":15.033333333333333,"appliedStats":{"53":12.5,"42":26.6,"43":6.0},"appliedTotal":45.1,"externalId":"2019","id":"002019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"41":25.0,"42":266.0,"43":1.0,"4

Jarvis Landry and paired with a gifted young quarterback for the first time in his career, Beckham could thrive in his debut with the Browns against a secondary that struggled to contain receivers in 2018. The Titans allowed the ninth-most yards and 12th-most yards per catch to wideouts.","2":"Targeted on 12 of 43 routes in the loss to the Titans, Beckham was the clear top option in the Cleveland passing game in Week 1. However, Beckham's 10 air yards per target ranked third on the team and could stand to improve against the Jets, whose secondary was regularly gashed by Buffalo's passing attack in Week 1. Due for some positive regression, Beckham is in a strong spot back in North Jersey for a Week 2 prime-time game.","3":"With a target on 26% of his routes this season, Beckham is earning elite usage in Cleveland. The next test comes Sunday against the Rams' talented duo of cover corners. Even in a tougher matchup, Beckham's heavy involvement in the passing game should drive another WR1 performance.","4":"An average of just 5.9 air yards per target led to just 9.3 yards per reception in a quiet Week 3 outing for Beckham, who still paced the Browns with nine targets.

a tumultuous but highly productive five seasons in New York, Beckham was traded to the Browns during the offseason. After finishing each of his first three NFL seasons with 1,300-plus receiving yards, 10-plus touchdowns and as a top-7 fantasy receiver, Beckham has managed a total of 1,354 yards and nine touchdown receptions while missing 16 of 32 games because of injury during the past two seasons. Though his play came back to earth a bit in 2018, Beckham ranked top 8 at the position in fantasy points per game for the fourth time in five seasons. Baker Mayfield's new No. 1 target is a strong bet to blow by 1,000 receiving yards for the fifth time in six seasons. The 26-year-old is a midpack WR1 with elite upside.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":18.881892028333336,"appliedStats":{"53":49.2,"102":0.0633006,"72":-1.24459574,"24":2.06,"25":0.6000000000000001,"26":0.007656702,"42":128.8,"43":46.2,"44":0.870002778,"63":0.02634},"appliedTotal":226.58270434000002,"externalId":"2018","id":"102018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":3.5,"24":20.6,"25":0.1,"26":0.003828351,"27":4.0,"28":2.0,"29":1.0,"35":0.006366489,"36":0.004456542,"37":0.00102,"38":3.47E-5,"39":5.885714285714286,"40":1.287916425,"41":98.4,"42":1288.0,"43":7.7,"44":0.435001389,"45":0.146908057,"46":0.096004415,"47":257.0,"48":128.0,"49":64.0,"50":51.0,"51":25.0,"52":12.0,"53":98.4,"54":19.0,"55":9.0,"56":4.86451644,"57":0.150448962,"58":168.1,"60":13.089430894308942,"61":80.50297518,"62":0.43882974,"63":0.00439,"66":0.038028616,"67":1.080008405,"68":1.1,"70":0.017493163,"71":0.604804707,"72":0.62229787,"73":0.62229787,"102":0.0105501,"115":12.73956061,"210":12.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":1.0,"42":2.0},"appliedTotal":3.0,"externalId":"401128018","id":"01401128018","proTeamId":5,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"0":1.0,"2":1.0,"41":2.0,"42":20.0,"47":4.0,"48":2.0,"49":1.0,"210":1.0,"53":2.0,"58":7.0,"59":5.0,"155":1.0,"60":10.0,"61":20.0}},{"appliedAverage":15.143527886200001,"appliedStats":{"53":44.06176025,"72":-0.8331906,"24":2.327753609,"25":0.5858850419999999,"26":0.01114828,"42":121.63034900000001,"43":58.177253694,"44":1.174281296,"63":0.017677722},"appliedTotal":227.15291829300003,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":3.970153095,"24":23.27753609,"25":0.097647507,"26":0.00557414,"27":4.0,"28":2.0,"29":1.0,"35":0.007297653,"36":0.005108357,"37":0.001320975,"38":4.50798E-5,"39":5.863133116,"40":1.545396587,"42":1216.30349,"43":9.696208949,"44":0.587140648,"45":0.242541167,"46":0.158500652,"47":243.0,"48":121.0,"49":60.0,"50":48.0,"51":24.0,"53":88.1235205,"54":17.0,"55":8.0,"56":4.329828375,"57":0.133912218,"58":140.2222076,"60":13.80225714,"61":80.75043915,"62":0.592714788,"63":0.002946287,"66":0.032319157,"67":0.7173723,"68":0.749691456,"70":0.014866812,"71":0.401728488,"72":0.4165953,"73":0.4165953,"210":15.0625}},{"appliedStats":{"53":3.034040134,"72":-0.076425138,"24":0.12296945370000001,"25":0.028769603999999997,"26":6.24606E-4,"42":8.464867580000002,"43":2.912931936,"44":0.057686558,"63":0.00162},"appliedTotal":14.547084733700002,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":0.211254651,"24":1.229694537,"25":0.004794934,"26":3.12303E-4,"35":3.88178E-4,"36":2.71725E-4,"37":5.72E-5,"38":1.95E-6,"39":5.820911071,"40":1.229694537,"42":84.6486758,"43":0.485488656,"44":0.028843279,"45":0.014197825,"46":0.009278278,"47":16.0,"48":8.0,"49":4.0,"50":3.0,"51":1.0,"53":6.068080268,"54":1.0,"56":0.334545194,"57":0.0103,"58":9.915485219,"60":13.94982796,"61":84.6486758,"62":0.029155582,"63":2.7E-4,"66":0.002309552,"67":0.066339598,"68":0.06864915,"70":0.001062394,"71":0.037150175,"72":0.038212569,"73":0.038212569,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":3.076576226,"72":-0.078025638,"24":0.1303663904,"25":0.03574077,"26":6.64992E-4,"42":8.841499715000001,"43":3.2665219260000002,"44":0.067622532,"63":0.00165},"appliedTotal":15.3426169134,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":0.220179612,"24":1.303663904,"25":0.005956795,"26":3.32496E-4,"35":4.04611E-4,"36":2.83228E-4,"37":6.49139E-5,"38":2.21526E-6,"39":5.920911071,"40":1.303663904,"42":88.41499715,"43":0.544420321,"44":0.033811266,"45":0.015689795,"46":0.010253281,"47":17.0,"48":8.0,"49":4.0,"50":3.0,"51":1.0,"53":6.153152452,"54":1.0,"56":0.360679748,"57":0.011155044,"58":10.09528174,"60":14.36905681,"61":88.41499715,"62":0.034143762,"63":2.75E-4,"66":0.002421683,"67":0.067676508,"68":0.070098191,"70":0.001113974,"71":0.037898844,"72":0.039012819,"73":0.039012819,"210":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":14.690454311923077,"appliedStats":{"53":38.09799054,"72":-0.964755824,"24":1.875444185,"25":0.45725989199999995,"26":0.009443292,"42":106.3061212,"43":44.29694976,"44":0.876996016,"63":0.020456994},"appliedTotal":190.975906055,"externalId":"2019","id":"122019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{"23":3.159430626,"24":18.75444185,"25":0.076209982,"26":0.004721646,"27":3.0,"28":1.0,"35":0.005807237,"36":0.004065066,"37":0.001062053,"38":3.62438E-5,"39":5.936019515,"40":1.442649373,"42":1063.061212,"43":7.38282496,"44":0.438498008,"45":0.185103286,"46":0.120964997,"47":212.0,"48":106.0,"49":53.0,"50":42.0,"51":21.0,"53":76.19598108,"54":15.0,"55":7.0,"56":4.074491352,"57":0.126015196,"58":124.5956307,"60":13.95167038,"61":81.77393939,"62":0.443219655,"63":0.003409499,"66":0.03

Williams barely played in the first half of the 2018 season, but Kareem Hunt's release led to a huge opportunity for him. He didn't disappoint, producing 352 yards and six touchdown on 60 touches in Weeks 14-17. Only two backs scored more fantasy points in the stretch. It's fair to be a bit suspicious of the now-27-year-old Williams after the small sample of success, especially after the team signed LeSean McCoy, but Williams still could lead the high-scoring Chiefs in touches out of the backfield.

The oversized back rushed for 12 scores (third-most) thanks to 13 carries inside the 5 (fourth-most). Despite playing a situational role most of the season, Henry's 238-yard, four-touchdown effort in Week 14 vaulted him into a larger role down the stretch. He was the top-scoring fantasy back by 17 points from that point on. Henry has been very efficient as a rusher (top-three in YAC each of the past two seasons) but has yet to clear 15 receptions in a season.

led the NFL in rushing yards per game (149) during the final eight weeks of last season. Ingram should enjoy a heavy workload in an offense that relies heavily on the ground game, especially against Miami, which allowed the seventh-most yards per rush and the sixth-most rushing scores in 2018.","2":"Ingram's first carry as a Raven went for 49 yards, and his five touches within 10 yards of the goal line led the league in Week 1 . While he wasn't targeted once on his four routes against the Dolphins, Ingram should feast, along with Lamar Jackson, in what could be the league's best rushing attack. The Cardinals have allowed 2,595 rushing yards to opponents dating to Week 1 of last season, the most in football. All signs point to another strong showing from Ingram.","3":"Ingram struggled to get untracked for Baltimore in Week 2, when he had a modest 1.7 yards before initial contact per carry vs. Arizona. There is real hope for a Week 3 bounce-back effort in Kansas City, which has allowed 111.1 rushing yards per game to backfields since the start of last season—the fifth-highest rate in the league. Despite a lack of upside as a receiving threat, Ingram is well positioned for early-down success this Sunday.","4":"In the loss to the Chiefs in Week 3, Ingram became just the third player in Ravens history with 100 rushing yards and three rushing scores a game, joining Willis McGahee (2009) and Jamal Lewis (2003). It was also good to see Ingram with four targets on his 16 routes in Week 3, which was a clear uptick.

joins the Ravens after an eight-year stint in New Orleans. Following a slow start to his career, Ingram has averaged 4.73 YPC, including 2.10 after contact, the past six seasons. Those marks rank first and second, respectively, among 31 backs with 650 carries in that span. Ingram ranks second in the league in rushing touchdowns (39), second in rushing OTD (37.5) and tied for first in carries inside the opponent's 5-yard line (61) the past five seasons. The 29-year-old Ingram is a strong bet to pace the extremely run-heavy Ravens' backfield in carries and possibly targets. Ingram has a real shot to eclipse his previous career-high carry total of 230 (2017). He's a flex option who can be upgraded slightly in non-PPR.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":13.084113383333333,"appliedStats":{"53":17.79865039,"72":-1.718010408,"24":69.65177047,"25":36.515643228,"26":0.244467442,"42":26.22720946,"43":8.158387452,"44":0.088948248,"63":0.042294318},"appliedTotal":157.0093606,"externalId":"2018","id":"102018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":152.6081641,"24":696.5177047,"25":6.085940538,"26":0.122233721,"27":139.0,"28":69.0,"29":34.0,"30":27.0,"31":13.0,"32":6.0,"33":30.0,"34":15.0,"35":0.312836168,"36":0.218985317,"37":1.775061858,"38":0.060576051,"39":4.564092024877455,"40":60.89772282,"41":35.59730078,"42":262.2720946,"43":1.359731242,"44":0.044474124,"45":0.049243237,"46":0.032180455,"47":52.0,"48":26.0,"49":13.0,"50":10.0,"51":5.0,"52":2.0,"53":35.59730078,"54":7.0,"55":3.0,"56":0.133466603,"57":0.004127833,"58":41.3231875,"60":7.36775229731337,"61":22.93089351,"62":0.166707845,"63":0.007049053,"66":1.454399586,"67":0.339252489,"68":1.793652075,"70":0.66902381,"71":0.189981394,"72":0.859005204,"73":0.859005204,"210":12.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":0.5,"72":-2.0,"24":7.1000000000000005,"26":2.0},"appliedTotal":7.6000000000000005,"externalId":"401128018","id":"01401128018","proTeamId":33,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"33":2.0,"34":1.0,"68":1.0,"39":5.917,"72":1.0,"40":71.0,"41":1.0,"73":1.0,"108":1.0,"109":1.0,"210":1.0,"53":1.0,"23":12.0,"24":71.0,"26":1.0,"58":1.0,"59":4.0,"27":14.0,"28":7.0,"156":1.0,"29":3.0,"158":2.0,"30":2.0,"31":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":2.0,"24":10.3,"25":18.0,"42":3.2},"appliedTotal":33.5,"externalId":"401127953","id":"01401127953","proTeamId":33,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":16.0,"24":103.0,"25":3.0,"27":20.0,"28":10.0,"29":5.0,"30":4.0,"31":2.0,"32":1.0,"33":3.0,"34":1.0,"37":1.0,"39":6.438,"40":103.0,"41":4.0,"42":32.0,"47":6.0,"48":3.0,"49":1.0,"50":1.0,"53":4.0,"58":4.0,"59":33.0,"60":8.0,"61":32.0,"156":1.0,"158":18.0,"179":2.0,"180":1.0,"210":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":13.117095303133336,"appliedStats":{"53":18.232803365,"72":-2.790789802,"24":102.6994485,"25":45.518695392,"26":0.41209942,"42":27.55349626,"43":4.935142206,"44":0.125934206,"63":0.0696},"appliedTotal":196.75642954700004,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":225.3875185,"24":1026.994485,"25":7.586449232,"26":0.20604971,"27":205.0,"28":102.0,"29":51.0,"30":41.0,"31":20.0,"33":45.0,"34":22.0,"35":0.467421233,"36":0.327194863,"37":2.899252144,"38":0.0989,"39":4.556572128,"40":68.18220647,"42":275.5349626,"43":0.822523701,"44":0.062967103,"45":0.060678418,"46":0.039653346,"47":55.0,"48":27.0,"49":13.0,"50":11.0,"51":5.0,"53":36.46560673,"54":7.0,"55":3.0,"56":0.1139153,"57":0.003523154,"58":44.15955555,"60":7.556022986,"61":18.2927776,"62":0.269016813,"63":0.0116,"66":2.534304052,"67":0.410026853,"68":2.944330904,"70":1.165779864,"71":0.229615038,"72":1.395394901,"73":1.395394901,"210":15.0625}},{"appliedStats":{"53":0.9043407835,"72":-0.163701524,"24":7.370868434000001,"25":3.97360341,"26":0.040102078,"42":1.381104507,"43":0.295640634,"44":0.006598436,"63":0.004104},"appliedTotal":13.812660758500003,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":16.07916196,"24":73.70868434,"25":0.662267235,"26":0.020051039,"27":14.0,"28":7.0,"29":3.0,"30":2.0,"31":1.0,"33":3.0,"34":1.0,"35":0.033873027,"36":0.023711119,"37":0.237787651,"38":0.00811478,"39":4.584112312,"40":73.70868434,"42":13.81104507,"43":0.049273439,"44":0.003299218,"45":0.004229489,"46":0.002763971,"47":2.0,"48":1.0,"53":1.808681567,"56":0.005210915,"57":1.61162E-4,"58":2.15320348,"60":7.635973807,"61":13.81104507,"62":0.023350257,"63":6.84E-4,"66":0.156504749,"67":0.017604602,"68":0.174109352,"70":0.071992185,"71":0.009858577,"72":0.081850762,"73":0.081850762,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":0.7904094065,"72":-0.121411828,"24":5.256630748,"25":2.845914342,"26":0.030056928,"42":1.209381809,"43":0.268146852,"44":0.005776842,"63":0.0030319860000000004},"appliedTotal":10.287937085500001,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":11.46749305,"24":52.56630748,"25":0.474319057,"26":0.015028464,"27":10.0,"28":5.0,"29":2.0,"30":2.0,"31":1.0,"33":2.0,"34":1.0,"35":0.023260867,"36":0.016282607,"37":0.120827643,"38":0.004123384,"39":4.583940645,"40":52.56630748,"42":12.09381809,"43":0.044691142,"44":0.002888421,"45":0.004254027,"46":0.002780007,"47":2.0,"48":1.0,"53":1.580818813,"56":0.004508097,"57":1.39426E-4,"58":1.882946247,"60":7.65035056,"61":12.09381809,"62":0.017916886,"63":5.05331E-4,"66":0.113004893,"67":0.01557797,"68":0.128582862,"70":0.051982251,"71":0.008723663,"72":0.060705914,"73":0.060705914,"210":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":13.67

10th-fewest yards to receivers last season, but target volume often leads to fantasy success. Boyd is the top receiving threat on the team with A.J. Green sidelined and is poised to demand as many as 10 targets in Seattle on Sunday afternoon.","2":"Tied for the Bengals' team lead with 12 targets in Week 1, Boyd's average depth of target (6.92 air yards) played a big part in limiting his yardage. Boyd netted 9.52 air yards per target last season, suggesting he's due for more valuable downfield usage against a 49ers team that has allowed the sixth-most yards per reception to receivers since the start of last season.","3":"An impressive catch rate of 81.8% fuels strong value for Boyd despite not yet having many big plays. But keep this in mind: the Bills' stellar pass defense has surrendered the fewest receiving yards.","4":"Boyd, who leads the Bengals in targets by a sizable margin, is a fine WR2 option against a struggling Steelers secondary,. He's due at least a quarter of Andy Dalton's attempts for this Week 4 matchup."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":7.53405572755418,"averageDraftPosition":83.75947995666306,"percentChange":-0.31982207656557193,"percentOwned":93.71878384160864,"percentStarted":60.652279318002364},"proTeamId":4,"rankings":{"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":17,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":20,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":20,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":20,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":17.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":17.666666666666668,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":20,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":20,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":20,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":17,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":17,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":19,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":19.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":16.833333333333332,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":23,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":16,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":26,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":22,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":32,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":22,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":24.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":19.833333333333332,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":15,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":32,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":13,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":18,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":14,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":25,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":32,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":32,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":11,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":4},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRa

selected Boyd in the second round of the 2016 draft. The former Pitt star's first two NFL seasons weren't particularly inspiring and he was even a healthy scratch at times in 2017. It's safe to say the light went on in 2018. With all eyes on second-year John Ross, Boyd came out of nowhere to post a 75/1016/7 line and finish 17th among receivers in fantasy points despite missing two games. Boyd was only 11 behind A.J. Green in targets during the eight full games the two played together. His efficiency was also terrific (71 percent catch rate, 9.6 YPT), though touchdown sustainability is a real concern after he saw only four end zone targets and posted a 3.3 OTD. Boyd is still only 24, so it's possible we've yet to see his best work. He's a solid WR3 target.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":5.416246942928571,"appliedStats":{"53":18.976913175,"72":-0.462317566,"42":43.371853890000004,"43":13.826734524,"44":0.104539744,"63":0.009733434},"appliedTotal":75.82745720099999,"externalId":"2018","id":"102018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"41":37.95382635,"42":433.7185389,"43":2.304455754,"44":0.052269872,"45":0.127975969,"46":0.083632296,"47":86.0,"48":43.0,"49":21.0,"50":17.0,"51":8.0,"52":4.0,"53":37.95382635,"54":7.0,"55":3.0,"56":0.29457642,"57":0.009110611,"58":58.48039061,"60":11.427531308710854,"61":27.10740868,"62":0.052269872,"63":0.001622239,"67":0.412783541,"68":0.412783541,"71":0.231158783,"72":0.231158783,"73":0.231158783,"210":14.0}},{"appliedAverage":10.537281439812501,"appliedStats":{"53":39.924620915,"72":-0.649808318,"24":1.119528448,"25":0.284609652,"26":0.003404678,"42":101.89706310000001,"43":25.573506090000002,"44":0.429843524,"63":0.013734948},"appliedTotal":168.59650303700002,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":1.803079189,"24":11.19528448,"25":0.047434942,"26":0.001702339,"27":2.0,"28":1.0,"35":0.003310139,"36":0.002317097,"37":2.62585E-4,"38":8.96E-6,"39":6.208981033,"40":0.69970528,"42":1018.970631,"43":4.262251015,"44":0.214921762,"45":0.238079468,"46":0.155584932,"47":203.0,"48":101.0,"49":50.0,"50":40.0,"51":20.0,"53":79.84924183,"54":15.0,"55":7.0,"56":2.891808711,"57":0.089437383,"58":118.0180233,"60":12.76118105,"61":63.68566446,"62":0.216624101,"63":0.002289158,"66":0.01286262,"67":0.569620275,"68":0.582482895,"70":0.005916805,"71":0.318987354,"72":0.324904159,"73":0.324904159,"210":16.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":3.2431596905,"72":-0.06674667,"24":0.1209288838,"25":0.038797014,"26":4.67606E-4,"42":7.750103406,"43":1.3587798420000001,"44":0.022893676,"63":0.0014125560000000001},"appliedTotal":12.469796004300001,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":0.193304289,"24":1.209288838,"25":0.006466169,"26":2.33803E-4,"35":3.55136E-4,"36":2.48595E-4,"37":5.52E-5,"38":1.88E-6,"39":6.255882084,"40":1.209288838,"42":77.50103406,"43":0.226463307,"44":0.011446838,"45":0.012775544,"46":0.008348818,"47":15.0,"48":7.0,"49":3.0,"50":3.0,"51":1.0,"53":6.486319381,"54":1.0,"56":0.281777349,"57":0.008714763,"58":9.322424933,"60":11.9483839,"61":77.50103406,"62":0.011680641,"63":2.35426E-4,"66":0.001733609,"67":0.058171205,"68":0.059904814,"70":7.9746E-4,"71":0.032575875,"72":0.033373335,"73":0.033373335,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":2.9021046575,"72":-0.060201638,"24":0.11605186460000001,"25":0.026918712,"26":3.39756E-4,"42":6.656920327000001,"43":0.9867427440000001,"44":0.016656414,"63":0.0012720000000000001},"appliedTotal":10.6468048371,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":0.185508395,"24":1.160518646,"25":0.004486452,"26":1.69878E-4,"35":3.40789E-4,"36":2.38552E-4,"37":5.04987E-5,"38":1.72333E-6,"39":6.255882084,"40":1.160518646,"42":66.56920327,"43":0.164457124,"44":0.008328207,"45":0.011520948,"46":0.00752894,"47":13.0,"48":6.0,"49":3.0,"50":2.0,"51":1.0,"53":5.804209315,"54":1.0,"56":0.200510876,"57":0.0062,"58":8.214753895,"60":11.46912519,"61":66.56920327,"62":0.008498085,"63":2.12E-4,"66":0.001674002,"67":0.052376389,"68":0.054050391,"70":7.70041E-4,"71":0.029330778,"72":0.030100819,"73":0.030100819,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":3.0,"42":6.800000000000001},"appliedTotal":9.8,"externalId":"401127915","id":"01401127915","proTeamId":4,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"41":6.0,"42":68.0,"47":13.0,"48":6.0,"49":3.0,"50":2.0,"51":1.0,"53":6.0,"54":1.0,"58":11.0,"59":23.0,"60":11.333,"61":68.0,"108":1.0,"109":1.0,"156":1.0,"210":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":11.25450414676923,"appliedStats":{"53":38.45380822,"72":-0.793499728,"24":1.58781751,"25":0.5332545120000001,"26":0.006208128,"42":89.97811657,"43":16.247737806,"44":0.27830876,"63":0.01680213},"appliedTotal":146.308553908,"externalId":"2019","id":"122019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{"23":2.545463771,"24":15.8781751,"25":0.088875752,"26":0.003104064,"27":3.0,"28":1.0,"35":0.004676694,"36":0.003273686,"37":7.44929E-4,"38":2.54216E-5,"39":6.237831894,"40":1.221398084,"42":899.7811657,"43":2.707956301,"44":0.13915438,"45":0.154119073,"46":0.100716814,"47":179.0,"48":89.0,"49":44.0,"50":35.0,"51":17.0,"53":76.90761644,"54":15.0,"55":7.0,"56":2.859548666,"57":0.088439649,"58":110.3316494,"60":11.69950659,"61":69.21393583,"62":0.142258445,"63":0.002800355,"66":0.022828462,"67":0.689729948,"68":0.71255841,"70":0.010501092,"71":0.386248771,"72":0.396749864,"73":0.396749864,"210":13.0}},{"appliedAverage":13.078571428571431,"appliedStat

Then again, Brissett has more experience and should pepper Hilton with valuable vertical targets against a solid, if still exploitable, Los Angeles secondary. There is a fairly wide spectrum of outcomes possible for the Colts' wide out in this contest, with enough upside to keep him in the WR2 discussion.","2":"A strong opener saw Hilton become the first Colts receiver with multiple scores in Week 1 since Reggie Wayne did so against the Saints in 2007. Hilton, who had some rewarding red-zone attention, led the team in routes and targets, offsetting his average of just 7.4 air yards per target. Up next are the Titans, who rank 24th in yardage allowed to wide outs since the start of last season. With a good matchup and rewarding role, Hilton is a solid WR2 for Week 2.","3":"Three scores through two games is a solid clip, especially in the wake of Andrew Luck's departure. The Falcons struggled in coverage against the Eagles' second unit receivers in Week 2, revealing some promise for Hilton to excel in this matchup.","4":"A re-aggravation of a quad injury saw Hilton leave Week 3 a bit early after producing a solid line that included his fourth score of the season. We'll need to track Hilton's progress in practice this week ahead of what is a juicy matchup with a Raiders secondary allowing the eighth-most fantasy points to

missing two games last season, Hilton finished as fantasy's No. 14 scoring wide receiver. Hilton has now finished all seven of his NFL seasons as a top 27 fantasy receiver. Hilton, who has missed only four games in his NFL career, averaged 16.7 YPR last season and has ranked above the 80th percentile in the category each of the past five seasons. He has ranked above the 85th percentile in YPR four of the past five seasons. Hilton's main concern area is touchdowns, as he has never managed more than seven scores in a single season and hasn't caught more than six since 2014. Hilton has ranked outside the top 30 wide receivers in end zone targets during each of the past two seasons. Hilton's value takes a hit following Andrew Luck's retirement, especially considering he was held to four touchdowns and a 55 percent catch rate (both career lows) with Jacoby Brissett under center in 2017. Consider Hilton a fringe

exciting name in the Eagles backfield, but the rookie still must contend with the capable Jordan Howard, who remains the most seasoned goal-line and early-down worker. Sanders, however, could still thrive for fantasy purposes, considering Doug Pederson's offense has propped up multiple backs in the past. Against Washington, who has many flaws on offense, Philadelphia could ride Howard late in the game if the predicted Eagles domination holds up. Still, Sanders deserves flex consideration for Week 1 fantasy lineups.","2":"Sanders led the Eagles backfield in carries but didn't gain much (25 yards) in the process. Expect Philadelphia to continue its committee approach in Week 2, though the Falcons, who were just trampled by the Vikings' ground game, is a friendly matchup for the visitors. Sanders counts as at least a fantasy flex and has major upside if he were to become the hot hand over Jordan Howard.","3":"Sanders has spun his wheels, managing just 2.5 yards-per-carry so far this season, even as he remains the top option in the Eagles backfield. However, Week 3 could be tantalizing. The Lions have allowed 169.5 RB scrimmage yards-per-game. Sanders and Jordan Howard could each enjoy a big day, and the Eagles may rely more heavily on the run if at least one of Alshon Jeffery (calf), DeSean Jackson (groin) and Dallas Goedert (calf) is forced to be inactive. Sanders looks like a strong flex play with the upside of a high-end RB2 if things go in Philadelphia's favor, allowing them to chew time off the clock late.","4":"Sanders totaled 126 scrimmage yards in Week 3 as the Eagles dealt with numerous injuries to its receiving corps. The rookie contributed 73 yards through the air to help with that issue. Though he lost one of two fumbles, he should be back to claiming a big role in the backfield for Week 4, especially with the quick turnaround for Thursday's visit to the Packers. Count him as a high-end fantasy flex, at the very least."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":2.9938080495356036,"averageDraftPosition":111.35977998166514,"percentChange":-0.24873639456838248,"percentOwned":83.64807502538201,"percentStarted":23.133087178844573},"proTeamId":21,"rankings":{"0":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":38,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":31,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":28,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":28,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":38,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":34,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":40,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":27,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":31,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":26,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":30.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":31.166666666666668,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":28,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":34,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":34,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":34,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":39,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":34,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":38,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":32,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":39,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":28,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":34.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":34.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":33,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":33,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":33,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":33,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":35,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":31,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":36,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":28,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":33,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":27,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":31.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":32.166666666666664,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":28,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":60,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":23}]},"seasonOutlook":"The Eagles selected Sanders in the third round of April's draft. He joins fellow newcomer Jordan Howard atop the Philadelphia depth chart. Saquon Barkley's replacement at Penn State racked up 220 carries in 2018 and was one of the nation's most elusive backs, evading one tackler for every 6.4 touches. Sanders is shifty and agile, but not especially explosive and he's struggled with fumbles (five last season). Sanders checks in at 5-foot-11, 211 pounds and is a solid receiver and kick returner (which also fills a void for the Eagles). He had a very good combine, which was highlighted by a 4.49 40-yard dash and position-best 6.89 three cone. Sanders' shiftiness makes him a terrific complement to between-the-tackles bruiser Howard.

expectations when a player is selected with the top pick in the NFL Draft, and things don't always pan out right away. That said, the Cardinals are going to give Murray the keys to the offense right out of the gate in a matchup with a below-average pass defense. The Lions allowed the third-highest passer rating in the NFL last season, meaning this is a good first test for the rookie. He's easily a QB2 in Week 1, and it's not out of the question to consider him as a starter in a 1-QB league.","2":"Murray threw the ball an impressive 54 times in his NFL debut as the Cardinals climbed back from an early deficit to force a tie. He only completed 53.7% of those throws, however, which is a little on the low side. Plus, for such a dynamic athlete, you'd like to see more than just three rushing attempts, at least from a fantasy standpoint. Facing a Ravens defense that kept the Dolphins in check in Week 1 and that ranked as the third-worst matchup for opposing quarterbacks last season, it's safe to keep the rookie on your bench in Week 2.","3":"Murray has looked good at times during his first two NFL starts, flashing the ability that prompted him to leave behind his career in baseball for the gridiron and enticed the Cardinals to select him with the No. 1 overall pick in the draft. However, he's still yet to produce anything with his legs and has only two touchdowns in two games. That's not really a recipe for success againts a Panthers defense that has kept both Jared Goff and Jameis Winston to low double-digit fantasy points over the first two weeks. He's got the volume to merit a start in 2-QB leagues, but otherwise he's best left on the bench.","4":"Murray is one of the busiest quarterbacks in the NFL, leading the league in passing attempts through three weeks and carrying the ball 14 times, as well. That hasn't translated directly into fantasy points, so he's on the cusp of QB1 status rather than being at the top of the scoring charts. However, it's still an encouraging sign and a situation unlikely to change any time soon. He's going to air it out under head coach Kliff Kingsbury and has proven to be effective enough to take opportunities and make big plays. He's worth consideration for a start in Week 4 against the Seahawks,  against whom Andy Dalton, Mason Rudolph and Teddy Bridgewater have all thrown for a pair of touchdowns.

was the first overall selection in April's draft and a strong favorite to open 2019 as Arizona's starter. The Oklahoma product is extremely undersized (5-foot-10, 207 pounds), but exceptionally efficient with his arm (he set an FBS record with an 11.6 YPA last season) and highly productive with his legs (1,001 rushing yards while averaging 7.2 YPC last season). There have been only three top-10 and six top-14 fantasy seasons by rookie quarterbacks over the past decade, but all who accomplished that did a lot of damage with their legs -- an area in which Murray will shine. Rookies are always risks, but Murray's skill set and path to snaps means he should be viewed as a QB2 with QB1 upside. He's worth a late-round pick in your

relatively uneventful offseason. At least he showed up while his contract negotiations escalated. Once again set to lead a run-first offense -- focused on either Ezekiel Elliott or a Tony Pollard-led committee -- Prescott remains worth rostering in most fantasy games, though he typically will settle into the high-end QB2 territory. Mark him as one of those against the Giants, who have little consistency to offer with the ball outside Saquon Barkley, meaning Dallas should keep things focused on the ground game in Week 1.","2":"Prescott rolled over the Giants in Week 1 with a ridiculous 96.9 Total QBR, enjoying the debut of Kellen Moore's offensive scheme. This change looks to be an immensely positive development for Prescott's fantasy upside, as the design featured more three-wide sets and accentuated downfield plays more often. Prescott averaged 281 passing yards, 1.5 passing scores and 25.5 rushing yards in his two clashes with Washington last year and profiles as a decent QB1 in Week 2.","3":"Prescott again looked like an MVP in Kellen Moore's new offense on Sunday, torching Washington for three more passing touchdowns, with just four incompletions over 30 attempts, while adding 69 rushing yards to the mix. He's looking unstoppable at the moment and conveniently will get the Dolphins at home in Week 3. Prescott may get to take off the helmet early, should Miami suffer its third straight blowout loss, but he'll probably have plenty of opportunities to do damage before he goes. He's a strong fantasy QB1.","4":"Prescott has accounted for three-plus total touchdowns in each of his first three games with Kellen Moore as offensive coordinator. The new, more inventive system in Dallas has raised Prescott's weekly fantasy ceiling. The Saints have allowed the most QB fantasy points-per-game this season, so slide Prescott into your fantasy lineups with confidence as a QB1."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":6.068111455108359,"averageDraftPosition":58.58896574714559,"percentChange":0.41295023832248035,"percentOwned":98.24147229029917,"percentStarted":79.41595685730118},"proTeamId":6,"rankings":{"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":6.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":5.333333333333333,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":5.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":5.833333333333333,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":2.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":2.1666666666666665,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":2,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":3,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":4.25,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":4.333333333333333,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":0}]},"seasonOutlook":"Prescott has finished sixth, 11th and 10th, respectively, in fantasy points during his three NFL seasons. Efficient and consistent, he's finished in the upper-third in completion percentage, has thrown either 22 or 23 touchdowns and has rushed for exactly six touchdowns each of the three seasons. Prescott was limited by 56 sacks last season (second most), but the return of center Travis Frederick should help cut that number down. The 25-year-old gets the job done with his arm, is one of the game's better rushing quarterbacks and has Amari Cooper, second-year Michael Gallup and now Jason Witten and Randall Cobb at his disposal.

The Browns were one of just eight teams to allow as many as 1,000 yards to tight ends last season, evidence Walker can return starting value in the opener.","2":"Leading his team in routes, targets, catches, and touchdowns is a pretty good way for Walker to declare his return to the top of the Tennessee passing game. Now that we know Walker is back in full force, we can get excited about this promising matchup with a Colts defense that has one glaring flaw; tight ends. Since the start of last season, the Colts have allowed the most yards (1,258) to tight ends by a sizable margin (league average is 881).","3":"Walker didn't match Week 1's awesome output, but still led the team in targets with an encouraging depth of target around 11 yards downdfield in the process. The Jags have been middle-of-the-pack defending tight ends since the start of last season (18th in yards allowed), while a steady stream of targets should sustain another strong showing from Walker.","4":"The most valuable receiving threat on Tennessee even late into his career, Walker's strong batch of targets each week drives TE1 status ahead of a meeting with a Falcons back seven allowing nearly 13 fantasy points per game to the position in PPR formats this season."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":1.4411764705882353,"averageDraftPosition":113.29843281093697,"percentChange":1.9501990665691125,"percentOwned":90.79759930562429,"percentStarted":62.67502689709041},"proTeamId":10,"rankings":{"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":9.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":9.166666666666666,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6}],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":10,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":8,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":12,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":9,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":7.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":9.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6}],"3":[],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":6,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":58,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":58,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":58,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":4,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":7,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":4.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":4.666666666666667,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":6},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":69,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":23},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":58,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":23}]},"seasonOutlook":"Walker is back after his 2018 season was derailed by a broken ankle after only 38 snaps.

Prior to 2018, Walker had appeared in at least 15 games in seven consecutive seasons and, from 2014-17, finished no lower than ninth at tight end in targets, receptions and receiving yards.

talked up Bernard netting increased work as a third-down threat this season. Before we get too excited about the Danny Woodhead vibes, it's best to remember he's still a change-of-pace back behind a top talent at the position. At best, Bernard is poised as a fringe flex in deep PPR formats given the Seahawks allowed the third-most receiving yards to backs last year.","2":"A strong pickup this week given Joe Mixon's ankle injury, Bernard was third on the Bengals in scrimmage yards and topped the team with nine touches in Week 1. If Mixon sits or proves limited in Week 2, Bernard could emerge as a worthy flex against the 49ers. Otherwise, he's a risky flex option given a minority share of touches and snaps.","3":"Bernard didn't cut into Joe Mixon's work in Week 2 despite playing just nine fewer snaps in the Bengals' loss. Bernard was held to fewer than two yards per touch against San Francisco and could again struggle to find room against the Bills, who have been solid against the run dating to the start of last season.","4":"Back to a complementary role with just five total touches in Week 3, Bernard isn't worth flexing for the Bengals' meeting with a shaky Steelers rush defense."}},"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":0.22445820433436534,"averageDraftPosition":167.77881490124176,"percentChange":-10.02343815446853,"percentOwned":27.994936200541268,"percentStarted":2.826386154581165},"proTeamId":4,"rankings":{"0":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":35,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":false,"rank":35,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2}],"1":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":43,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":40,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":40,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":40,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":47,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":35,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":41,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":41,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":48,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":42.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":41.833333333333336,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":45,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"2":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":27,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":29,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":27,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":38,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":30,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":32,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":39,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":34,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":37,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":34.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":31.5,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":32,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"3":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":42,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":40,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":42,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":41,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":41,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":37,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":45,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":41,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":45,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":43.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":41.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":44,"rankSourceId":9,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2}],"4":[{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":37,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":37,"rankSourceId":8,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":37,"rankSourceId":7,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":37,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":34,"rankSourceId":6,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":35,"rankSourceId":5,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":37,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":37,"rankSourceId":3,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"published":true,"rank":42,"rankSourceId":2,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":36.75,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":2},{"auctionValue":0,"averageRank":37.0,"published":true,"rank":0,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"PPR","slotId":2},{"auctionV

has been one of the league's best receiving backs since he entered the league in 2013, but his role has diminished in recent seasons as a result of injuries (10 missed games the past three seasons) and the emergence of workhorse Joe Mixon. Bernard posted career-low marks in both carries (56) and receptions (35) last season. His 4.7 YPT was second-worst at the position and marks the first time in six seasons that he didn't finish top-20 in the category. Undersized and uninvolved near the goal line, Bernard hasn't cleared four touchdowns in a season since 2014. He is no more than a backup who steals some passing-down work from Mixon. His primary value is as a handcuff.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":8.660431845416667,"appliedStats":{"53":20.385253825,"72":-0.759646354,"24":33.82475841,"25":9.438017514,"26":0.068767264,"42":34.712352110000005,"43":6.190693422000001,"44":0.046805954,"63":0.01818},"appliedTotal":103.92518214500001,"externalId":"2018","id":"102018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":81.837037,"24":338.2475841,"25":1.573002919,"26":0.034383632,"27":67.0,"28":33.0,"29":16.0,"30":13.0,"31":6.0,"32":3.0,"33":16.0,"34":8.0,"35":0.157196759,"36":0.110037731,"37":0.312063149,"38":0.0106,"39":4.133184637415453,"40":22.45627114,"41":40.77050765,"42":347.1235211,"43":1.031782237,"44":0.023402977,"45":0.073797565,"46":0.048226709,"47":69.0,"48":34.0,"49":17.0,"50":13.0,"51":6.0,"52":3.0,"53":40.77050765,"54":8.0,"55":4.0,"56":0.175249529,"57":0.00542,"58":53.16399147,"60":8.514083858850357,"61":23.04554497,"62":0.057786609,"63":0.00303,"66":0.513978031,"67":0.256059433,"68":0.770037464,"70":0.236429894,"71":0.143393282,"72":0.379823177,"73":0.379823177,"210":12.0}},{"appliedAverage":7.174327753733333,"appliedStats":{"53":23.36953938,"72":-0.692462138,"24":30.80273347,"25":11.83519287,"26":0.141579952,"42":37.5085801,"43":4.55681502,"44":0.076587226,"63":0.016350426},"appliedTotal":107.614916306,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"23":72.12316756,"24":308.0273347,"25":1.972532145,"26":0.070789976,"27":61.0,"28":30.0,"29":15.0,"30":12.0,"31":6.0,"33":14.0,"34":7.0,"35":0.137806523,"36":0.096464566,"37":0.259333918,"38":0.008850072,"39":4.27085145,"40":20.44994753,"42":375.085801,"43":0.75946917,"44":0.038293613,"45":0.052048307,"46":0.034013569,"47":75.0,"48":37.0,"49":18.0,"50":15.0,"51":7.0,"53":46.73907876,"54":9.0,"55":4.0,"56":0.20983425,"57":0.006489719,"58":62.4852302,"60":8.02510043,"61":24.90196189,"62":0.10908359,"63":0.002725071,"66":0.42074227,"67":0.272660045,"68":0.693402314,"70":0.193541444,"71":0.152689625,"72":0.346231069,"73":0.346231069,"210":15.0625}},{"appliedStats":{"53":1.03749659,"101":0.044496,"72":-0.059454616,"24":2.4057368290000003,"25":1.14869076,"26":0.013844728,"42":1.740597158,"43":0.259681878,"44":0.004375302,"63":0.00144},"appliedTotal":6.596904628999998,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":5.799128668,"24":24.05736829,"25":0.19144846,"26":0.006922364,"27":4.0,"28":2.0,"29":1.0,"33":1.0,"35":0.011205486,"36":0.00784384,"37":0.0252,"38":8.6E-4,"39":4.148445337,"40":24.05736829,"42":17.40597158,"43":0.043280313,"44":0.002187651,"45":0.004193699,"46":0.002740583,"47":3.0,"48":1.0,"53":2.07499318,"56":0.007210323,"57":2.23E-4,"58":2.719040606,"60":8.38844761,"61":17.40597158,"62":0.009110015,"63":2.4E-4,"66":0.045015849,"67":0.016107175,"68":0.061123024,"70":0.02070729,"71":0.009020018,"72":0.029727308,"73":0.029727308,"101":0.007416,"114":27.81,"116":2.0,"117":1.0,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":1.342360824,"72":-0.063357636,"24":2.308712241,"25":0.8076848939999999,"26":0.010194224,"42":2.1466065480000003,"43":0.267675426,"44":0.004518414,"63":0.0015165960000000003},"appliedTotal":6.825911530999999,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":5.565251854,"24":23.08712241,"25":0.134614149,"26":0.005097112,"27":4.0,"28":2.0,"29":1.0,"33":1.0,"35":0.010731495,"36":0.007512046,"37":0.023211495,"38":7.92119E-4,"39":4.14844162,"40":23.08712241,"42":21.46606548,"43":0.044612571,"44":0.002259207,"45":0.003418945,"46":0.00223428,"47":4.0,"48":2.0,"49":1.0,"53":2.684721648,"56":0.010674137,"57":3.30128E-4,"58":3.520608812,"60":7.995639136,"61":21.46606548,"62":0.007356319,"63":2.52766E-4,"66":0.043386818,"67":0.020930145,"68":0.064316963,"70":0.019957936,"71":0.011720881,"72":0.031678818,"73":0.031678818,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"53":1.0,"24":0.5,"42":0.7000000000000001},"appliedTotal":2.2,"externalId":"401127915","id":"01401127915","proTeamId":4,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"23":3.0,"24":5.0,"27":1.0,"39":1.667,"40":5.0,"41":2.0,"42":7.0,"47":1.0,"53":2.0,"58":2.0,"59":7.0,"60":3.5,"61":7.0,"108":1.0,"109":1.0,"156":1.0,"210":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":6.587838943,"appliedStats":{"53":13.234412795,"101":0.5796764999999999,"72":-0.775474792,"24":31.54131362,"25":15.788444219999999,"26":0.183808472,"42":21.67869366,"43":3.3350754600000005,"44":0.057133796,"63":0.018822528},"appliedTotal":85.64190625900001,"externalId":"2019","id":"122019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{"23":76.36391313,"24":315.4131362,"25":2.63140737,"26":0.091904236,"27":63.0,"28":31.0,"29":15.0,"30":12.0,"31":6.0,"33":15.0,"34":7.0,"35":0.147743555,"36":0.103420488,"37":0.33827958,"38":0.011544184,"39":4.130395

with Austin Ekeler with Melvin Gordon still out of the picture, Jackson's lack of work in the receiving phase limits the appeal of his fantasy profile. It also helps to consider the Colts allowed the sixth-fewest yards per carry to tailbacks last season.","2":"Efficient as a rushing threat (9.5 yards per carry) in the opener, Jackson is a talented rushing complement to Austin Ekeler, but not nearly the receiving threat his peer has become. Without a strong stake in the passing game Jackson is tough to trust in fantasy lineups, although the Lions' soft rush defense (4.7 yards per carry to backs since the start of last season) at least offers some promise.","3":"Offseason talk of an even workload split between Jackson and Austin Ekeler has quickly shifted to Ekeler as the featured back and Jackson as an early-down reprieve. Without any really upside as a receiver, Jackson is outside the flex tier for this meeting with the Texans.","4":"The Dolphins are weak enough against the run to consider streaming Jackson in deeper leagues and for those with desperate running back depth charts.

Leave him on waiver wires until alerted otherwise.","2":"Gallman found the end zone in Week 1. Saquon Barkley didn't. Gallman's score came in garbage time, though, and he unsurprisingly ran as the clear backup. Leave him on fantasy waiver wires for Week 2.","3":"Gallman didn't record a touch in Week 2, reminding us that if the game is close, Saquon Barkley will consume all possible backfield work. No need to add him off the waiver wire for Week 3.","4":"Gallman is expected to step in as the top back in place of Saquon Barkley, who's out for at least a month with a high-ankle sprain. In Week 3, after stepping in when Barkley got hurt, Gallman had just 13 yards. He'll face a Washington defense that's given up only 19.9 RB fantasy points-per-game, ranking in the bottom half of the league.

The Chargers' talented pass rush presents some upside, however, as this group is in the streaming tier at the position ahead of this trip to Detroit.","3":"Facing Deshaun Watson is never a great matchup, but there are some reasons to think this Chargers D/ST could produce respectable results.

The unit has ranked top-eight in points allowed each of the past two seasons but fell from sixth in both forced turnovers (27) and interceptions (18) in 2017 to 16th (20) and 15th (13), respectively, in 2018. Corey Liuget, Darius Philon and Jahleel Addae are notable offseason subtractions, but Thomas Davis and early-round picks Jerry Tillery and Nasir Adderley were huge additions at need spots. Additionally, edge rusher Joey Bosa will be healthy opposite Melvin Ingram this time around. Add that group to Casey Hayward, Derwin James (once back from IR) and Desmond King, and you have a strong unit on paper. Consider the Chargers' D/ST a top-10 unit.","stats":[{"appliedAverage":6.447631626125,"appliedStats":{"96":15.630075,"97":2.745786888,"98":0.722,"99":39.3572654,"101":1.010718,"102":3.1178277119999995,"103":7.74,"104":7.0634768580000005,"93":0.75,"95":25.02495616},"appliedTotal":103.162106018,"externalId":"2018","id":"102018","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2018,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"93":0.125,"94":2.467246143,"95":12.51247808,"96":7.8150375,"97":1.372893444,"98":0.361,"99":39.3572654,"100":78.0,"101":0.168453,"102":0.519637952,"103":1.29,"104":1.177246143,"105":3.279003577,"106":12.02313462,"112":66.38675125,"113":71.9,"114":725.9799706,"115":307.8063506,"120":322.0074711,"121":16.0,"126":20.12546695,"127":5454.551622,"131":16.0,"137":340.9094764,"160":-322.0074711,"210":16.0}},{"appliedAverage":5.941497889,"appliedStats":{"96":13.642305784,"97":1.475901,"98":0.537866352,"99":41.03322417,"132":-7.0,"101":0.59454,"102":3.8299115100000005,"103":8.35562574,"104":4.52444076,"123":-2.0,"92":2.0,"93":0.779733108,"95":27.2904178},"appliedTotal":95.063966224,"externalId":"2019","id":"102019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"92":2.0,"93":0.129955518,"94":2.14667775,"95":13.6452089,"96":6.821152892,"97":0.7379505,"98":0.268933176,"99":41.03322417,"100":82.06644833,"101":0.09909,"102":0.638318585,"103":1.39260429,"104":0.75407346,"105":3.014041853,"106":10.49408137,"109":920.5211317,"110":306.0,"111":184.0,"113":72.30969888,"114":773.636,"115":392.9357106,"116":77.0,"117":30.0,"118":39.0,"119":15.0,"120":318.3286664,"121":8.0,"122":4.0,"123":2.0,"126":19.89554165,"127":5633.354358,"131":9.0,"132":7.0,"137":352.0846474,"160":-318.3286664,"210":16.0}},{"appliedStats":{"96":0.706883236,"97":0.0833576,"98":0.030661116,"130":2.0,"99":3.720365827,"101":0.03708,"102":0.223531272,"103":0.47961012,"104":0.25687968,"92":1.0,"93":0.043366020000000005,"95":2.10712011},"appliedTotal":10.688854980999999,"externalId":"20194","id":"1120194","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"92":1.0,"93":0.00722767,"94":0.1227483,"95":1.053560055,"96":0.353441618,"97":0.0416788,"98":0.015330558,"99":3.720365827,"100":7.440731655,"101":0.00618,"102":0.037255212,"103":0.07993502,"104":0.04281328,"105":0.173411182,"106":0.543756336,"109":52.48884747,"110":17.0,"111":10.0,"113":3.722966563,"114":49.06163265,"115":22.01060606,"116":4.0,"117":1.0,"118":2.0,"120":15.56797465,"126":15.56797465,"127":290.4791954,"130":1.0,"137":290.4791954,"160":-15.56797465,"210":1.0}},{"appliedStats":{"96":0.838704196,"97":0.093418,"98":0.034361596,"99":4.081530145,"132":-1.0,"101":0.03708,"102":0.232868514,"103":0.5374941,"104":0.2878824,"93":0.04859985,"95":1.626934896},"appliedTotal":6.818873697000001,"externalId":"20193","id":"1120193","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":3,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"93":0.008099975,"94":0.13756275,"95":0.813467448,"96":0.419352098,"97":0.046709,"98":0.017180798,"99":4.081530145,"100":8.163060291,"101":0.00618,"102":0.038811419,"103":0.08958235,"104":0.0479804,"105":0.190654144,"106":0.645157075,"109":59.25717674,"110":19.0,"111":11.0,"113":4.096700808,"114":49.09666667,"115":23.49483871,"116":4.0,"117":1.0,"118":2.0,"120":19.94015301,"121":1.0,"126":19.94015301,"127":360.7865838,"132":1.0,"137":360.7865838,"160":-19.94015301,"210":1.0}},{"appliedAverage":6.947502501692308,"appliedStats":{"96":12.072989882,"128":15.0,"97":1.4271396,"98":0.524939468,"130":2.0,"99":29.84106718,"132":-2.0,"133":-6.0,"101":0.48306375,"102":2.917771116,"103":8.08852122,"104":4.44800448,"123":-2.0,"92":4.0,"93":0.74245617,"95":18.771579656},"appliedTotal":90.31753252200001,"externalId":"2019","id":"122019","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{"92":4.0,"93":0.123742695,"94":2.08942095,"95":9.385789828,"96":6.036494941,"97":0.7135698,"98":0.262469734,"99":29.84106718,"100":59.68213437,"101":0.080510625,"102":0.486295186,"103":1.34808687,"104":0.74133408,"105":2.779969456,"106":9.286915295,"109":906.1229989,"110":302.0,"111":181.0,"113":65.17385335,"114":639.1557781,"115":287.3061553,"116":63.0,"117":25.0,"118":28.0,"119":11.0,"120":327.5333498,"121":4.0,"122":6.0,"123":2.0,"126":20.47083436,"127":4521.536978,"128":3.0,"130":1.0,"131":8.0,"132":2.0,"133":2.0,"137":282.5960611,"160":-327.5333498,"210":13.0}},{"appliedStats":{"128":0.0,"129":0.0,"130":2.0,"99":5.0,"132":0.0,"133":0.0,"134":0.0,"135":0.0,"136":0.0,"89":0.0,"90":0.0,"123":0.0,"91":3.0,"92":0.0,"124":0.0,"95":2.0},"appliedTotal":12.0,"externalId":"401128055","id":"01401128055","proTeamId":24,"scoringPeriodId":4,"seasonId":2019,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{"192":0.0,"128":0.0,"193":0.0,"129":0.0,"194":0.0,"130":1.0,"195":0.0,"131":0.0,"132":0.0,"133":0.0,"134":0.0,"135":0.0,"136":0.0,"210":1.0,"89":0.0,"90":0.0,"155":1.0,"91":1.0,"92":0.0,"95":1.0,"99":5.0,"100":10.0,"10
